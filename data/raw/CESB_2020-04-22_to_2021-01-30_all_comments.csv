It has royally fucked me over, because I moved and had to drop school due to COVID and applied to 6 other jobs but wouldn't take me at the time. So I had to move back to my parents with the girlfriend, an hour at least, from the nearest town with work. 

Never even got the first CERB till later than the first period, because I wanted to be sure.

Just applied for an apartment as well just a week before they told me, so its really not cool. Should've just been a temporary basic income for everyone.

There's a phone number on the government website to call to apply for CESB without speaking to a person and if that doesn't work, call a different number to speak to an agent. I did that (since the self apply phone number didn't let me apply for some reason) and the agent on the other end helped me apply for both August and July sections at the same time. The waiting time for an agent can take a while so I don't suggest beginning a phone call later than 3:30 (the calling hours end at 5pm but they might close early which is what happened on the first day for me). 

The phone numbers I tried were

\- The one on the ""how to apply"" page when it asks if you've ever filed taxes and clicked no

\- 1 800 959 8281

PaulC28,"If you earned over $1,000 in either month, then you are not eligible. Your wage is your gross pay which typically includes: take-home wage + CPP deductions + EI deductions + income tax withholdings. The fact that your employer forgot to deduct CPP and EI doesn't preclude his requirement to withhold those amounts, so the numbers related to that CPP and EI still have to be reconciled one way or another. There's two likely outcomes. In either case, you need to communicate with your employer and get written confirmation.

For example, in July:

* Scenario #1: If your employer paid you $990 + will be sending in your portion of CPP and EI and income tax withholdings, then you are not eligible. Your taxable income with respect to July becomes $990 + the CPP and EI that he remits on your behalf.
* Scenario #2: If your employer paid you $990 and will require you to repay him the CPP and EI that should have been deducted, then you are eligible. Your gross taxable income will remain $990.

If your employer provides you with the option and you both are unsure of which case is correct, I would opt to repay him the CPP and EI to ensure you are eligible for CESB. Often times employers just don't know how to handle payroll and don't know what to do.

If your employer doesn't have a proper payroll system in place, then I would request a written letter from him confirming that he paid you $990 in July and $950 in August, forgot to withhold any CPP or EI, and will be requiring you to repay him those amounts. Ensure you retain written proof of this, and also copies of your bank statements showing the transfers of cash (receipt of e-transfers + repayments of CPP and EI).

The reason you should get a letter is because if your employer forgets, or has an accountant/bookkeeper/payroll service prep the T4's for 2020, he might report your income incorrectly not remembering what was done. T4's for 2020 are prepared in 2021, so a lot gets forgotten, and often times the employer doesn't even take part in prepping the T4's. If an accountant looked at it and saw no deductions were withheld, they'd most likely bump your income up and have him send in CPP and EI withholdings on your behalf to the CRA, thus increasing your taxable income in those months. But, if you have a letter stating what your income was for those months, stating that you owed him CPP and EI, and bank statements showing the transfer of money, then you'd have proof.

**edit:** Also, are you being paid as an employee, or as self-employed? Typically employers don't e-transfer and not provide pay slips. If you're being paid as being self-employed, then there's nothing more you need to do -- you will handle your own CPP and EI on your tax return.",1599177983.0,2020,2020-09-03,5,g3xdoh9,t3_im1y6s,t3_im1y6s

PaulC28,"Are you asking about whether income is based on the days worked vs. the days pay is received? If so, the CESB Act and the CESB Regulations are unclear.

The relevant wording from the CESB Act in relation to the timing of income is in paragraph 6(1)(b):

""they do not, in respect of any part of that four-week period, receive""

The CESB Act uses the term ""receive"", not ""earn"". ""Receive"" is a cash-basis term, which would make one think that income will be assessed based on when it is received.

However, if you look to the wording ""in respect of"", this is accrual-basis wording. My interpretation of what this means: Income received during the period that is not in respect of that period is not relevant to your eligibility criteria for that particular period.

**In summary:** I think because the Act refers to income as being received ""in respect of"" the four-week period, eligibility under CESB will be assessed based on when it is earned, not when it is received.

**EDIT:** The CRA has published an article clarifying how they want employers to report income: [https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/campaigns/covid-19-update/support-employers-cra-covid-19.html#reporting](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/campaigns/covid-19-update/support-employers-cra-covid-19.html#reporting)

See this excerpt from the above-linked article:

>""Code 57: Employment income – March 15 to May 9  
>  
>Code 58: Employment income – May 10 to July 4  
>  
>Code 59: Employment income – July 5 to August 29  
>  
>Code 60: Employment income – August 30 to September 26  
>  
>Eligibility criteria for the CERB, CEWS, and CESB is based on employment income for a defined period. The new requirement means employers should report income and any retroactive payments made during these periods.  
>  
>Example  
>  
>**If you are reporting employment income for the period of April 25 to May 8, payable on May 14, use code 58.**""

This really muddles things. While this doesn't explicitly provide an interpretation, this shows that the CRA wants more information about when income is **paid**, not when it is earned.",1599084454.0,2020,2020-09-02,1,g3rym7u,t3_ik9rkn,t3_ik9rkn

PaulC28,"The CESB Act and its Regulations contain no limitations on this. In fact, the Regulations for CESB define a dependant under paragraph 1(a) as ""a child (including an adopted child, a stepchild or a foster child) who is under 12 years of age and is wholly dependent on the student or the student’s spouse or common-law partner for their care and upbringing"".

The important thing to note is that the child can be wholly dependant on you OR your spouse.  This means that one or both of you can be taking care of one child and you both would still be eligible. The other important thing to note is the age limitation (12 years and under). 

This can be confusing, as it is unlike other tax credits for children, which typically contain limitations to the claim (to limit a claim to a per-child or per-spouse basis). Also, unlike other tax credits, a child is defined as 12 and under, rather than under the age of 18.

PaulC28,"The actual law doesn't have any written language that directly deals with this issue. The CESB Act and its regulations state that if you are earning $1,000 or less, this must be for reasons related to COVID. Unlike CERB, the requirements for CESB do not limit your claim based on voluntarily reducing your hours; if you chose to work less, but one or more of your reasons for doing so relates to COVID, then this might not invalid your claim.

Also note that the CESB Act does not state ""for reasons *primarily* relating to COVID"", nor ""for *unavoidable* reasons relating to COVID""; it just says ""for reasons relating to COVID"". This is very open language, and it has yet to be determined where the line is drawn in terms of what is considered a valid ""reason relating to COVID"".

Another area some people have had confusion about is the conditions of CESB. Some people are conflating requirements under one condition with another. For example, the CESB Act states that if you claim CESB based on being unemployed, that you must be actively seeking work. This criteria only applies to those who claim CESB based on being unemployed, and does not apply to those claiming CESB based on earning $1,000 or less. This means that if you are earning under $1,000, the Act does not require you to be seeking additional work hours; it would seem like that SHOULD be the law, but it's not. 

In my opinion the CESB Act should have been worded better. The CESB Act should have been worded such that those earning under $1,000 should be seeking additional hours but are unable due to COVID. However, this just wasn't how they decided to word it.

In summary: If you feel you were earning $1,000 or less for reasons relating to COVID, then those reasons may make you eligible even if you voluntarily limited your work hours. However, you would need to have a valid reason for why you voluntarily limited your work hours, and that reason would have to be related to COVID.

If you truly have no reasons relating to COVID, then I would not advise you to claim CESB. This goes against the spirit of what was intended. But, it is very important that you are aware of your exact rights and the written law, so that you can make your own informed decision based on your own circumstances.",1599088388.0,2020,2020-09-02,1,g3s6x6s,t3_ihtuwv,t3_ihtuwv

>I wondered about her applying for CERB - because she did make over $5000 in 2019 before starting school in August 2019 - so I thought she may technically be eligible for that.

So first off, unless she was working and her job ended specifically because of COVID-19, then she does not qualify, even if she made enough money to qualify last year. 

>We haven't applied for the CESB because she was a full-time student, but now as expected there is not a lot of work available in her industry. CESB is ending of course and I've been told by CRA that unless she can demonstrate job applications (via Job Bank) for the full month she cannot apply for the August eligibility period. 

This is true, the only thing slightly wrong with it is she could have proved in other ways aside from the Job Bank that she was applying for jobs in August. If she wasn't applying for jobs in the hopes of getting a job and working in August, then she doesn't qualify for it. It sounds like she wasn't.

I'm sorry to be the bearer of this bad news, but honestly because of the way the system is set up, your wife doesn't qualify for the CESB or CERB. The CSSG would have helped your wife however that's been nixed (see ""WE scandal""). The only thing to do really is have her apply for any and all jobs she can and hope she gets one soon. You might also try writing to your MP explaining that your wife has been overlooked by the current system and asking for them to put something forward to help recent grads. 

Also if it wasn't clear, knowingly applying for the CESB or CERB when you don't qualify can carry some serious punishments.",1598483087.0,2020,2020-08-26,3,g2ypftk,t3_ih52bv,t3_ih52bv

So you didn't lose a TAship, you lost the ability to apply for a potential TAship. While I know it sucks, that's a pretty big difference from a rules standpoint - because you had no guaranteed position/accepted offer there's technically no guarantee you would have gotten the job if it even would have normally existed this term (while unlikely remember TA positions are fluid and subject to enrollment).

from wealthsimple trade: 

""Capital Gains Tax Rate

In Canada, 50% of the value of any capital gains are taxable. Should you sell the investments at a higher price than you paid (realized capital gain) — you'll need to add 50% of the capital gain to your income. This means the amount of additional tax you actually pay will vary depending on how much you're making and what other sources of income you have.""

according to this, capital gains are taxable income, but to be sure, ask the CRA for confirmation. also, the 1000$/month is counted as income before taxes, i just looked it up for another person asking the question, so you have to be careful when calculating your income. refer to the CESB webpage, it's written there.

PaulC28,"If you feel that you were overpaid, you can speak with your employer to request an adjustment to your pay stub and repay your employer the amount you were overpaid. Your employer would have to issue you an adjusted pay stub, which can be a nuisance for them (many employers do not know how to do this). If your employer accepts this adjustment and provides you with a written statement indicating your gross income, then this would likely be acceptable as well (however I bet you anything the CRA wants paystubs as proof of income if they perform a review -- so if you were ever reviewed, they'd probably want to speak to your employer in addition to reviewing a letter).

Remember also that if you are earning under $1,000 per month, this still has to be due to COVID. In the case of a review, you might also need to provide a reasonable explanation as to why you would otherwise be earning more than $1,000/month if not for COVID. If your employer cannot attest that you would have earned more otherwise, you may need to show that you were seeking other job opportunities. It is unlikely that they will review this condition, but it's worth being aware of it in order to prepare any necessary information.

HayleyTheLesbJesus,"There are two things here:
- disability that does not allow you to ""function"" in society or whatever their definition is. This can be, for instance, a learning disability or a cognitive one. This entitles you to 2000/month BUT you still have to look actively for work.
-health conditions that make it dangerous for you to work with covid going around. This entitles you to not have to be actively looking for jobs, BUT you only get 1,250 a month.

If you have asthma, for instance, this is a health condition. You don't have to look for work. You get 1,250 a month.

If you have ADHD, in the other hand, this is a disability. You get 2,000 a month.

If you've ADHD AND asthma, you don't have to look for work AND you get 2,000 a month.

I hope it clears some doubts for you :)

Edit : as for the last question, about your disability/health condition not being listed... I'd ask your family doctor/a doctor if they think whatever you have either:
- stops you from functioning normally in society (2000/mo)
- makes it dangerous for you to work during covid (no active job seeking)
And then call CRA phone number to confirm with them. This is not something you want to ""guess"", only to be wrong and owe money next year!",1597909517.0,2020,2020-08-20,3,g26xu70,t3_icywvl,t3_icywvl

If you wouldn't have been able to work regardless of Covid, you aren't eligible. 

They have provided a list where there are known risks. You may have another condition that is also a risk and that wouldn't mean you weren't eligible. I think the reason they gave a list is to avoid everyone with anxiety saying they were too anxious to work.

I'd say call them again, explain your situation, and if they give you the same answer as before then you probably have to wait it out. 

btw why didn't you apply earlier? like in May for the first payment? why did you apply now as it's already August? just curious

the reason why it is a bit more troublesome to apply now is that the CRA more likely than not increased its fraud detection system, several other posts here stated they encountered difficulties when applying for the 4th payment, even though they had no issues with their previous payments. you may have reasons for doing so, but you really should have created your account and applied earlier like in May. well it's not too late, but what I'm trying to say is that a lot of problems could have been avoided if you applied earlier, so you have more time to discuss your situation with the CRA.

OP is severely misinformed.

The world isn’t fair. Harsh, but reality. May as well wake up now to save yourself a world of hurt when you’re pushing 30.

- you can use any job-search site, Job Bank was a suggestion as it is a government-run entity and they want to look good and helpful; there’s countless jobs that require little or no experience especially now considering a lot of people left their jobs due to safety concerns so businesses are hurting - even remote jobs
- secondly, perhaps before complaining, fact-check yourself and take accountability for your own life/decisions; the CESB Backgrounder is easily accessible 
- I don’t know what province you’re from, or what your parents income is— did you ever consider applying for your province’s student loans? God forbid you go into debt for post-secondary. People thinking they’ll get through it (unless they have savings, financially supportive parents, inheritance, working, income of some sort etc.) is a farce. I’m 28 and in university, I’ve been in post-sec since 2011 and majority of people I know had to take out loans in some form, be that provincial assistance or a bank. It’s manageable if you follow the rules and create an actionable plan (money-management) should be a non-issue if you really research industries before entering school for something and see if it offers job security, forethought - what a concept

pegasus_y,"it could be one among several reasons why they would flag you, so hopefully you'll figure it out soon. 

but one potential reason is that when the CESB started, many students rushed to create CRA accounts and didn't file a complete tax return, especially didn't claim the education-related credits. these tax slips can be found in your student account at the education institution, you get one per year or per semester when you pay tuition fees. actually, claiming this non-refundable tax credit is an indirect way to prove you're a student, cuz you wouldn't have received that tax slip if you didn't pay tuition fees. this definitely can help avoid the CRA's red flags. 

i personally claimed every tax credit available that fits my situation, most are non-refundable credits so i don't get a direct payment from the CRA, but it does help avoid potential red flags on my file. in my case, i received the 4th payment without issue.

tylerhf,"No matter what anyone says, everything is an assumption at this point.

Usually audits happen when there’s a flag on your account from the computer.

Audits for CERB and CESB related issues won’t happen until after next tax season as most frauds will be pointed out by the system. 

For CESB and validating job searching. They said make a document and log everything you did. It can be applying for jobs, working on your resume, taking a job search course, etc. It’s not purely based on submitting resumes.

THE REST IS ASSUMPTIONS:

CERB is going to EASILY take priority of auditing.  It’s more money, the fund is WAY higher than expected, and the requirements are harder to meet imo. 

While CESB is way lower than the expected amount of applicants. It’s also less money per application which defers people intentionally taking advantage of the benefit.

We are also talking 8mil applications, they’re mainly going to be after the people that pop up in their system first. This will be people making over the $1k a month, didn’t submit their schools T4, etc.

pegasus_y,"your question is legit, but i don't think you need to worry about that if you've done everything in accordance with the CESB requirements. 

the only component of CESB that you need to do actively is to  look for work, the other requirements are cases of either you are or you are not. looking for work for instance on Indeed is really not complicated, in my view a lot easier than studying for 5 final exams, unless you have a disability, but that's not the case i presume. 

audits can occur months or years after the taxable event, which can be many things. in our case, it's the CESB payment given to students. 

i talked to my accountant before, and he said that there is nothing you can do to prevent an audit, but in the event that an audit occurs, you can help the CRA make things go smoothly by providing all documents and info they require, and make your case heard, being honest and straight forward with them will avoid the potential harsh penalties.

Proof of being unable to work could include:

* a note from a doctor or other regulated medical professional;
* a notarized letter confirming the reason they are unable to work as a result of COVID-19;
* proof of travel documents;
* emails or correspondence from a child’s care facility; or

**Reasons for being unable to work**

The reason for being “unable to work” must be related to COVID-19. Such reasons could include being in quarantine or ill, taking care of someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 or taking care of dependants while their school or care facility is closed.

Individuals in self-isolation/quarantine include:

* those who have tested positive for COVID-19 or are symptomatic and cannot otherwise physically or virtually attend work; and

* seeking work but are unable to find it; or
* working but unable to make more than $1,000 (before taxes) over the four-week period for which they are applying.

For those seeking work but unable to find it, they must continue to actively look for a job to be eligible for the CESB.

Reasons for being unable to work

The reason for being “unable to work” must be related to COVID-19. Such reasons could include being in quarantine or ill, taking care of someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 or taking care of dependants while their school or care facility is closed.

Individuals in self-isolation/quarantine include:

those who have tested positive for COVID-19 or are symptomatic and cannot otherwise physically or virtually attend work; and

those with underlying health conditions (heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, compromised immune system) who would face increased risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19.

Individuals providing care to others include:

those taking care of others who are in quarantine or sick due to COVID-19;

those living with someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 (adults over the age of 65; underlying health conditions, etc.); and

those taking care of children because their care facility or school is closed due to COVID-19.",1596634154.0,2020,2020-08-05,1,g0fxicy,t3_i3y4z0,t3_i3y4z0

 **Proof of disability**

A student with a disability must attest to having an impairment, such as a physical, mental, intellectual, cognitive, learning, communication or sensory impairment, or a functional limitation—whether permanent or episodic in nature, or evident or not—that, in interaction with a barrier, hinders a person’s full and equal participation in society.

Proof of having a disability could include:

* a note from a doctor or other regulated medical professional;
* proof of disability support from (i) the federal government or a provincial government or (ii) from an educational institution that you currently attend or have previously attended; or
* other documentation that provides clear evidence of the individual’s disability.",1596484455.0,2020,2020-08-03,3,g09074f,t3_i2wzb4,t3_i2wzb4

A student who is able to work must be looking for a job on a regular basis (i.e. at least three days per week) and must document all of their job search efforts for the duration of the CESB period. Evidence of a student’s active job search includes:

* regular documentation of job-search results, including search dates, application dates, tools used, employer names and the type for work that they looking for. Job Bank provides useful tools to document job search efforts;
* emails to prospective employers and responses to employers who contacted them;
* emails or documentation of enrollment and communication efforts with an employment agency;
* screen shots or links to job postings or copies of job ads, flyers, postings, etc. within a student’s local area;
* confirmation of enrollment or participation in job search workshops or job fairs;
* emails or screen shots of job applications submitted for suitable jobs; and
* emails to demonstrate that they attended job interviews in person, over the phone or virtually.",1596405703.0,2020,2020-08-02,7,g05b4fp,t3_i2hc8w,t3_i2hc8w

1) Its $1k before taxes. I'm not sure if you filled out the forms or not, but if you didn't and are being taxed on that its more than $82 you're over. Upside it you'll probably get some of it back come tax time. Given $1082*4 is a weird number ($4328) its possible you are being taxed in some way and you should have earned $4500. 

2) Why did you not notice this in May or June (assuming this was for an RAship through the summer)? Every RA positions I've usually spells out how much you'll earn upfront over the tenure, so even if its delayed you should have been able to just divide the amount by the number of months. If this wasn't a summer RAship this shouldn't matter and the money is yours.

So they want to keep subsidizing businesses to pay employees (even though they're clearly not hiring) but people that don't have a job come the end of the benefit period are SOL.

antisocialentity,"Personally, I would call and check with the CRA, but I think that you would be eligible.

According to the CESB backgrounder, there is no statement about whether or not quitting a job disqualifies you (this is not true for the CERB). If you haven't gotten any shifts from the job that you have for this month, then you would meet the ""working, but unable to make more than $1000"" requirement and that would mean you are eligible for the CESB (assuming you meet the other requirements). If you meet this requirement, you don't need to worry about looking for another job to be eligible. However, the issue with this requirement is that it doesn't specify whether or not you need to prove that you made less than $1000 because of COVID. Since it doesn't specify, I would say that it doesn't matter, but personally, I would want to cover my bases and apply for other jobs as a backup.

Also, I would apply for the CESB because it sounds like you are in a tight spot that it is, at the very least, related to the pandemic. If they audit you and find that you weren't eligible for the CESB, you can always just pay the money back later. Remember that if you are audited, it likely won't be until after the pandemic and by then you will be in a better position (hopefully) so once you get on your feet, set aside enough money to pay back the CESB just as a precaution. 

I want to add that if they do audit you, you can include a note (along with the requested documents) that explains your situation and you will be able to talk to CRA representatives along the way that will be able to help you.

Individuals in self-isolation/quarantine include:

* those who have tested positive for COVID-19 or are symptomatic and cannot otherwise physically or virtually attend work; and
* those with underlying health conditions (heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, compromised immune system) who would face increased risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19.

I'm in a similar situation as you, but I've had a job pre-covid and they kept most of us hired for after as well. I am also confused as to whether CRA will look at the paychecks received during eligibility period or if it would consider only the hours worked during the period. I currently work very little, as my employer is not able to give us many hours, so based on actual worked hours I earn far below 1k, but they also offer a top up to an established weekly average whenever I work under it. Therefore I have a chance of going over the 1k threshold by a few dollars based on 2 paychecks I'll earn in this CESB eligibility period. I am very worried as I am already struggling to pay for school and life expenses as is, and I don't know what might happen with my employment when I take a heavier course load in the Fall semester. 

Would CRA contact me for a repayment if I end up earning a few dollars above the 1k? How would I know whether I need to repay if I'm looking out for it myself? Has anyone had to pay the penalty yet, and if so how much is it?",1595970751.0,2020,2020-07-28,1,fzjy5de,t3_ht7l5m,t3_ht7l5m

>A student with a disability must attest to having an impairment, such as a physical, mental, intellectual, cognitive, learning, communication or sensory impairment, or a functional limitation—whether permanent or episodic in nature, or evident or not—that, in interaction with a barrier, hinders a person’s full and equal participation in society.

>Proof of having a disability could include:

>- a note from a doctor or other regulated medical professional;

>- proof of disability support from (i) the federal government or a provincial government or (ii) from an educational institution that you currently attend or have previously attended; or

>- other documentation that provides clear evidence of the individual’s disability.

The reason for being “unable to work” must be related to COVID-19. Such reasons could include being in quarantine or ill, taking care of someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 or taking care of dependants while their school or care facility is closed.

Individuals in self-isolation/quarantine include:

* those who have tested positive for COVID-19 or are symptomatic and cannot otherwise physically or virtually attend work; and
* those with underlying health conditions (heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, compromised immune system) who would face increased risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19.

Individuals providing care to others include:

* those taking care of others who are in quarantine or sick due to COVID-19;
* those living with someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 (adults over the age of 65; underlying health conditions, etc.); and
* those taking care of children because their care facility or school is closed due to COVID-19.

A student with a disability must attest to having an impairment, such as a physical, mental, intellectual, cognitive, learning, communication or sensory impairment, or a functional limitation—whether permanent or episodic in nature, or evident or not—that, in interaction with a barrier, hinders a person’s full and equal participation in society.

Proof of having a disability could include:

Most job postings I’ve seen so far have specifically mentioned in the description that they are looking for someone to fill the position on a permanent basis and that they don’t want students who will be returning to school. Makes sense for jobs other than ones where the work is essentially the same and the employees easily replaced. It is a sticky situation because I can see it from the side of the employer too - the training/on boarding process takes a week at least if not two and it is quite costly for a business to hire an employee in general, most people just aren’t aware of the hidden costs. Replacing people also costs money and with students heading back to school and looking for temporary work themselves, it kind of makes sense. 

Although I didn’t see a single CSJ position or any type of summer job that offered decent hours in my area this entire time. I could’ve applied at a grocery store and gotten 2 shifts a week, but also don’t want to earn like, $1250 and get screwed out of the rest of the CESB since I get the extra amount.

PhantomForces_Noob,"yeah, that's the problem with it, unless you make 2,149 a month or more, finding a job gets you less money.

welfare needs to be reworked so that for every 2 dollars you make above the payment, the payment reduces by 1 dollar. 

for example, if I make 1,200 per month, then my CESB payment would still be 1,150. (1,250 - (1200-1000)/2)",1594678938.0,2020,2020-07-13,11,fxz69d9,t3_hqojsx,t3_hqojsx

earths0ul,"I 100% agree with you on the fact that The Canada Job Bank and CSSG have proven to be a literal joke, and I get backlash from expressing these opinions so watch out. 

Also, you’re right. It’s already July 13th, and they can’t expect students to find a job now because the time to hire for the summer is basically over. Nobody will want to hire someone for 1.5 months as they will still need to train the new employee and that takes up company resources. Of course, it’s still possible to work at fast-food chains, retail or grocery stores, but realistically not everyone wants to do this. Luckily, I’ve found a job that I started awhile ago, but for people who have not I seriously wonder how ‘job searching’ will work soon and especially in August.",1594669814.0,2020,2020-07-13,6,fxynjug,t3_hqgmri,t3_hqgmri
SleepyQueer,"I'm right in the same boat. Job Bank is a joke, 100% useless. Maybe for recent graduates, but that's it. I really could use the last month of CESB but I'm hesitant to apply because as you aptly note, the seasonal job market is basically closed. A lot of ""seasonal"" positions are running into fall, and I can't take a permanent position as I can't continue to work once September hits. I can't even do retail or similar because of my miscellaneous health issues. I'm already anticipating having 3 weeks of ""looked on these websites, found nothing I could apply to"" on my job tracking sheet, and I don't feel like CRA would appreciate that being all of August too. If anyone's going to be audited it'll probably be me as I applied for the disability amount. I'm looking pretty much every day except stat holidays and weekends and finding squat at this point. I haven't even gotten any interviews so far this year, despite actually being able to apply to slightly more jobs than usual (13 this year vs. 9 last year) because of stuff being moved online. But with everything opening up now people don't want remote workers and summer hiring is basically over anyways.  


 It really frustrates me that this job hunting criteria was tacked onto a group for whom it made no sense because the seasonal job window closes halfway through the program. Realistically if they had to apply it to anyone, it would've made more sense to apply to CERB. And now they've bungled the volunteer program and frankly the payment scheme there was super shady, paying less than minimum wage and only in 100hr increments, especially since when I looked at the postings most of them were basically skilled jobs that would better suit a CSJ position. And while at least volunteering wouldn't exclude us from CESB, we'd still have to job hunt while basically already working a job which, given how little of summer is left and the increments in which we get paid, would probably be full time or even above full time for many. I'm glad we saw some targeted support, I'd be screwed without it. But I can't help but feel like all the way along it's been done in a way that's really kind of been a little insulting, obviously reluctant, and in some cases practically exploitative.",1594692710.0,2020,2020-07-13,3,fxzuskx,t3_hqgmri,t3_hqgmri
Hiddenlotvs,"Question: Would you say that having an open and ongoing FSWEP job search open on GC Jobs where the Government of Canada algorithm sends out your application to jobs of interest is one valid way of proving that you've been searching for work? I've had an ongoing FSWEP job search open since this time last year and I even updated it this year 2020 in January in order to look for Government level jobs but it has been doing a poor job in finding me anything at all. does this count? I'm not sure but I have also been calling companies here and there, participating in job information sessions on zoom, applying for jobs off the GC Jobs site and have recently taken it up a notch by applying to 10+ jobs off of the Job Bank and Indeed. Hopefully that is enough so far to not get deemed ""inelligible"" if I ever get asked by the CRA to present my job search info. I started off a bit slower , in the first CESB period I applied to a couple jobs, didn't get anything so I worked on my resume, second period I updated my cover letter and did research on some other job opportunities and in this third CESB period I have sent out a plethora of applications.

>**Reasons for being unable to work**

>The reason for being “unable to work” must be related to COVID-19. Such reasons could include being in quarantine or ill, taking care of someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 or taking care of dependants while their school or care facility is closed.

>Individuals in self-isolation/quarantine include:

>- those who have tested positive for COVID-19 or are symptomatic and cannot otherwise physically or virtually attend work; and

>- those with underlying health conditions (heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, compromised immune system) who would face increased risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19.

>Individuals providing care to others include:

>- those taking care of others who are in quarantine or sick due to COVID-19;
those living with someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 (adults over the age of 65; underlying health conditions, etc.); and

>- those taking care of children because their care facility or school is closed due to COVID-19.

>In addition, students studying abroad are considered “unable to work” if:

>- they are only authorized to work on campus, had been looking for work on campus but were unable to find it; and

>- they contacted the Canadian Embassy to be repatriated and are waiting to return to Canada.

>Note that someone who is unable to work due to reasons other than COVID-19 is not eligible for the CESB. For example, a full-time student who does not have time to work is not eligible.

 -

>**Documentation required**

>Applicants will be required to attest to meeting the eligibility criteria and that the information they are providing is accurate. They do not have to provide documents as part of their CESB application. However, students may be asked to produce documents in the future to support their attestation. They should keep records to support their attestation at a future date.

 -

>**Proof of being unable to work**

>Proof of being unable to work could include:

>- a note from a doctor or other regulated medical professional;

>- a notarized letter confirming the reason they are unable to work as a result of COVID-19;

>- proof of travel documents;

>- emails or correspondence from a child’s care facility; or

**Reasons for being unable to work**

The reason for being “unable to work” must be related to COVID-19. Such reasons could include being in quarantine or ill, taking care of someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 or taking care of dependants while their school or care facility is closed.

Individuals in self-isolation/quarantine include:

* those who have tested positive for COVID-19 or are symptomatic and cannot otherwise physically or virtually attend work; and
* those with underlying health conditions (heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, compromised immune system) who would face increased risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19.

Individuals providing care to others include:

* those taking care of others who are in quarantine or sick due to COVID-19;
* those living with someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 (adults over the age of 65; underlying health conditions, etc.); and
* those taking care of children because their care facility or school is closed due to COVID-19.

In addition, students studying abroad are considered “unable to work” if:

* they are only authorized to work on campus, had been looking for work on campus but were unable to find it; and
* they contacted the Canadian Embassy to be repatriated and are waiting to return to Canada.

Note that someone who is unable to work due to reasons other than COVID-19 is not eligible for the CESB. For example, a full-time student who does not have time to work is not eligible.",1594263803.0,2020,2020-07-08,2,fxdv0x9,t3_hnuefk,t3_hnuefk

JGal204,"You need to request the T4 from the company/job that you worked for if you can't access your T4 online. Lastly, you need to file your tax first before creating a CRA account so you need to do that in a tax software such as turbo tax, simple tax, etc. If tax software don't work for you, go to an H&R Block and they do the filing for you, there is a fee but since you just recently graduated high school, they are gonna give you a student discount, that's what i did but this is just my suggestion. The CESB stuff, it is much better if you have a CRA account because the process is much faster, even more if you set up for a direct deposit on your account but since you don't have an account, i suggest you still call them even it will take 3-4 hours to wait in order to apply for CESB and i believe their phone number is in high traffic so that's why it could take 2 hours like you said.

chemicalcanon," **Reasons for being unable to work**

The reason for being “unable to work” must be related to COVID-19. Such reasons could include being in quarantine or ill, taking care of someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 or taking care of dependants while their school or care facility is closed.

Individuals in self-isolation/quarantine include:

* those who have tested positive for COVID-19 or are symptomatic and cannot otherwise physically or virtually attend work; and
* those with underlying health conditions (heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, compromised immune system) who would face increased risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19.

Individuals providing care to others include:

* those taking care of others who are in quarantine or sick due to COVID-19;
* those living with someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 (adults over the age of 65; underlying health conditions, etc.); and
* those taking care of children because their care facility or school is closed due to COVID-19.

 

**Proof of being unable to work**

Proof of being unable to work could include:

* a note from a doctor or other regulated medical professional;
* a notarized letter confirming the reason they are unable to work as a result of COVID-19;
* proof of travel documents;
* emails or correspondence from a child’s care facility; or
* other documentation that provides clear evidence of the individual’s inability to work as a result of COVID‑19.

I inquired with a few employers asking for descriptions and one was moved to fall, one was cancelled, the rest never got back to me. I even signed up for the ""plus"" account but it does NOT actually track what I'm doing on there, it says I haven't clicked on or viewed application details of any jobs which is a lie. I have no job matches from them, particularly as most of my previous work was relatively physical but I suffered a significant decline in my health that means I can't so that kind of work anymore, even most retail jobs are out because of standing, bending, repetitive motions, lifting stock, etc. So job bank can't really match me with new jobs based on my old jobs because they're no longer suitable for me. It's so frustrating that we were singled out like this to job hunt to get less money than CERB and they suggest using a tool that really isn't designed to work well for students at all. The CSJ listings would be helpful if they had actual job descriptions but they don't and I get the sense that they're at least partially automated or at least not well managed.",1594086855.0,2020,2020-07-06,6,fx5vox5,t3_hmers0,t3_hmers0

**Reasons for being unable to work**

The reason for being “unable to work” must be related to COVID-19. Such reasons could include being in quarantine or ill, taking care of someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 or taking care of dependants while their school or care facility is closed.

Individuals providing care to others include:

* those taking care of others who are in quarantine or sick due to COVID-19;
* **those living with someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 (adults over the age of 65; underlying health conditions, etc.); and**
* those taking care of children because their care facility or school is closed due to COVID-19.

Proof of being unable to work could include:

* **a note from a doctor or other regulated medical professional;**
* a notarized letter confirming the reason they are unable to work as a result of COVID-19;
* proof of travel documents;
* emails or correspondence from a child’s care facility; or
* other documentation that provides clear evidence of the individual’s inability to work as a result of COVID‑19.

As long as you can prove you live with your brother who is immunocompromised, you would be unable to work due to COVID.

I don't expect anything now either as most jobs popping up extend into fall which I can't manage at the best of times, but especially not now as I'm starting my undergrad thesis in September. It's very frustrating that we're expected to job hunt through August if we want to stay on CESB, IMO this doesn't really make sense for most students who would likely be leaving work to return to F/T studies in Fall and thus wouldn't be particularly good employment candidates late in the summer. I'm fully expecting that most of July and all of August will just be me checking job boards every day and writing down that I didn't find anything I could even apply to. I don't really have a problem with not finding a job as my physical and mental health aren't great right now and I'm spending my time getting a head start on preliminary reading for my thesis but I worry about CRA harping on it if I get audited, which I probably will because I'm disabled and applied as such. :/ I know realistically anyone with any shred of human decency should understand, but I never trust CRA to be reasonable, and I also don't love being forced to spend time and energy job hunting when there's 0% chance of me finding a job because the seasonal job market is well and truly closed.

* regular documentation of job-search results, including search dates, application dates, tools used, employer names and the type for work that they looking for. Job Bank provides useful tools to document job search efforts;
* emails to prospective employers and responses to employers who contacted them;
* emails or documentation of enrollment and communication efforts with an employment agency;
* screen shots or links to job postings or copies of job ads, flyers, postings, etc. within a student’s local area;
* confirmation of enrollment or participation in job search workshops or job fairs;
* emails or screen shots of job applications submitted for suitable jobs; and
* emails to demonstrate that they attended job interviews in person, over the phone or virtually.

""(a)**for reasons related to the coronavirus disease 2019** and whether as an employee or in self-employment, they are unable to work, are seeking work and unableto find it, or **are working but are paid less than the amount determined under the regulations**, during the four-week period for which they apply for the benefit""

This means that, according to the actual law, people have to be earning less than $1000 BECAUSE of the coronavirus. If you have a job but just choose to only work 1 day a week because you want to play video games, you should need to look for another job or be unable to work because of coronavirus.

unable to work; or

seeking work but are unable to find it; or

working but unable to make more than $1,000 (before taxes) over the four-week period for which they are applying.""

Now, the official policy doesn't explain how this would actually be proven. But likely they will need to see income statements of you earning $1000/month before coronavirus and less than $1000 after.

For example, most of my classmates and I in university need to apply to around 30-50 jobs to get a Co-op offer.

So don’t worry, this is normal. The key is volume - you should be applying to as many jobs as possible.

I've been audited once after divorce where they tried to claim that I was still living with my ex-wife and we would need to file a joint tax return. They said I would need a statement from a doctor, lawyer, police officer, or bank manager or maybe a few other respected professionals who would state that they knew us and we weren't living together.

At the beginning of this period, I thought things were getting easier - physio clinics and such were reopening and I started seeing more postings for MOA jobs, including some that don't require completion of the certificate or prior MOA experience. I applied for 6 jobs in the first week of this period. It seems to have dropped off again since then though and I haven't found much to apply for the past couple weeks. 

Due to chronic illness, I can't manage more than part-time or anything that would require standing for long periods, so I'm pretty much looking for part-time office work, ideally temporary (since I won't be able to work on top of taking classes in the fall). That doesn't seem to exist though, at least at present. I hope it'll be easier to find work after graduation when I'll be looking for permanent rather than temporary...

This period I've applied for:

4 casual clerical hospital positions (not getting anywhere with these, but I keep applying anyway...)

4 part-time clinic positions (2 physio clinics, a walk-in clinic, and a specialist office)

So total of 8 applications.

SleepyQueer,"Disappointing that it was released so late and that it basically is the equivalent of a $10/hr job which is below minimum wage everywhere in Canada. Skimming a lot of the postings in my area, many don't even seem like they directly address COVID. They seem like they'd be better suited as CSJ positions getting a mostly or fully subsidized wage. But then they'd have to pay us more, I guess. 9.9 I also love that they're asking you to provide proof of registration for summer or fall, but I had to drop my summer courses to seek work for CESB and fall course registration hasn't opened yet because they had to delay it to give time to figure out how to deliver fall semester remotely due to COVID. So really I CAN'T apply now even if applications are open, because I can't prove to them that I'm registered, because I can't register yet, because COVID, which is the same reason I need the extra funds. Gives us even LESS time to earn some much needed money. And it looks like you only get paid in increments of 100 hours, so if you never meet that 100 hour threshold you get nothing and if you work like... 190 hours you only get compensated for 100 and not for the extra 90 which is frustrating.  


Is there any clarification on how this impacts CESB? It looks like it's open to people receiving CESB but if I'm ""volunteering"" full-time then it's a strain to be constantly looking for work as well. IMO if you're doing this ""volunteering"" full-time then you're basically working full-time and shouldn't have to job-seek for CESB, especially once we hit late July and August when no one wants to hire students that will have to leave in a few weeks anyways. But I can't imagine they'll give us a break on that, of course. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad we're finally seeing SOMETHING. But I am disappointed that many of the criteria for these different support programs seem particularly difficult for students, that we keep seeing supports come out late, and that the combination of criteria building up on us across programs doesn't seem to be taken into account either.

Ok-Pick8731,"I just want to say my situation was exactly like yours and it brings me so much relief that someone else went through the same situation as me. 

Some background, I applied to CERB through EI thinking I qualified but turns out I didn't because my income was a mix of employment income AND grants. CRA advised me to terminate the CERB with service Canada. I tried to terminate my account but the dude is right, SERVICE CANADA CANNOT TERMINATE THE ACCOUNT.

Heres where the story gets worse, I got in line with a CRA agent who for some reason went through my tax forms. He wrongly told me that I qualified for CERB and even insisted I reactivate my CERB claim. I, being a moron, decided to trust this agent since he was so sure and insistent. So I reactivated my claim and got 6000 from filling out reports.

A day later I got suspicious and called another CRA agent who confirmed that I did NOT qualify for CERB (at this point I wanted to cry). So I repaid 6000 at once to EI through direct deposit with no way to confirm if my payment went through and applied for CESB through CRA today.

1. Now if your in a similar situation I would advise to follow Timit's lead and just pay back your CERB until your left with $5000 (I did not know that was an option and seem's way less cumbersome than speaking to a CRA agent)
2. If you need to repay back the CERB through service Canada know that unlike CRA they have no way to tell you if the repayment went through at the moment. The only way so far that they will tell you is if you end up getting a tax form for the CERB payment at the end of the year (but a service Canada agent told me that in the future they may have more information)
3. If you want to apply for CESB after repaying cERB and it still won't let you the website, try the automated phone line first. If that doesn't work call the CRA tax inquiry line, starting from the 25th they are allowed to override the system and manually apply for CESB for you.

Timbits0422," Hey, I just made a post kind of about this as I had the same issue, so I just copy/pasted it here for you! Hope it helps you 

After getting my calls escalated until the last escalation I believe (5th one), an EI agent from the upper levels called me and this is what is going to happen if you applied for CERB, realized you didn't qualify, and now are trying to get CESB:

1. you need to keep calling to get your calls escalated so someone higher can call you. It's long and can be frustrating to wait on the phone just to explain the same situation over and over again but because you keep calling, once the upper agents call you, they recognize that you are aware you made a mistake by applying and are trying to fix it so they will do everything they can for this to happen. So keep calling!
2. For the full 4 months period, we can receive up to 5000, so claim your CERB through EI up to that amount and then stop. If you claimed more already, I am in the same boat. I claimed 6000$, which means there will be an overpayment of 1000$. However, because I am starting a new job on Thursday, I will also have to pay an overpayment for July and August, and I believe I can keep June since I won't be making 1000$ a month yet.
3. They CANNOT terminate the claim. They told me it would be put on hold for now, so if I get laid off work (which by then I would have reached the 5000$ criteria for CERB) I would be able to apply for CERB in the future if needed.
4. Because you recognize your mistake and take the steps necessary to ""try and cancel it"", you will not be penalized. If you were not eligible for CERB, you had until December to pay it back with no penalty. Now, with those steps taken, your claim will be reevaluated and recalculated to be processed as CESB for the periods you were eligible. You won't be penalized except that you will have to repay the overpayment.
5. The EI agent made sure to note all of that in my file so that if there is any issues, it is written in my file that this is what I was told to do and that there should not be penalties. This is why it is important you keep escalating your calls till you get a higher EI agent as I believe they are the only ones that can work on this issue and they will make sure it is in your file and that your claim gets sent for reevaluation in the future.
6. I did ask about the June 24th update, how we will be able to apply to CESB by phone through CRA. He told me his instructions were not to repay the full amount, and that it was 100% okay with the process that I did. Now, if you already repaid it, you can call on the phone for CESB, but for anyone that is wondering what to do, if you have got that money already and don't wanna go through the CRA process and paying it back, keep escalating your calls so they can reevaluate your EI CERB claim and modify it later into the CESB requirement claim.

This is the information I got from an upper EI agent after he called me. I am not saying other people did not get different directions, but this is what I will do as he seemed pretty confident about it and worst comes to worst I will have to fight it later if there are issues, but I really don't think/hope there will be by what he told me his instructions were. If you have more details, feel free to add to this or if you have any questions I can try and help but I am no expert :)",1592940170.0,2020,2020-06-23,4,fvrvixh,t3_hegaaa,t3_hegaaa

Onto the point, after 10+ calls to CRA, 10+ calls to EI Canada, I managed to get CESB. Heres what I recommend you do. 

1) Contact another agent (CRA or EI depending where you received CERB) and tell them again about your situation and make it clear you would like to terminate your claim and repay it (they can't terminate the claim but it's a way for them to note on file that your trying not to commit fraud).

2) Pay back the full amount you received in CERB in CRA or EI. If you don't have the funds to pay it back rn DON'T WORRY. As long as you pay anytime before December 2020 (when CERB payments are taxed) the payment amount will be readjusted and you WON'T get a tax form for CERB.

3) If you did that and still can't apply to CESB through your cRA login or automated phone line, call the individual tax inquiry line to speak with an agent. STARTING JUNE 25 they are allowed to override any restrictions and manually apply for CESB for you.

bridgemixture,"I think the info has been mixed. 

The [CESB eligibility page](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/benefits/emergency-student-benefit/cesb-who-apply.html) has said from the start that ONE of the following needs to apply:

>- you are unable to work due to COVID-19

>- you are looking for, but cannot find work due to COVID-19

>- you are currently working during the COVID-19 pandemic, but your income from employment and self-employment has been $1,000 or less (before taxes) during the 4-week period you are applying for

The only one of those that explicitly says ""looking for work"" is the ""cannot find work"" one.

The most recent update to the eligibility page changed it so that near the top of the page, it says:

>If you are able to work, you must be actively looking for work to be eligible to receive the CESB.

So I don't think it's 100% clear, but personally, I would look for work and document the steps you're taking, using your own spreadsheet/document or the [EI Job Search form](https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/content/EForms/en/Detail.html?Form=INS5240). (I wouldn't recommend relying on Job Bank to track what you're doing, as lots of people in this sub have said they'd had problems with it, and also, you may do better looking for jobs on other sites ex. Indeed.)

There's further info in the [backgrounder](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/news/2020/05/backgrounder-the-canada-emergency-student-benefit.html) about job search and documentation of it:

>A student who is able to work must be looking for a job on a regular basis (i.e. at least three days per week) and must document all of their job search efforts for the duration of the CESB period. Evidence of a student’s active job search includes:

>- regular documentation of job-search results, including search dates, application dates, tools used, employer names and the type for work that they looking for. Job Bank provides useful tools to document job search efforts;

>- emails to prospective employers and responses to employers who contacted them;

>- emails or documentation of enrollment and communication efforts with an employment agency;

>- screen shots or links to job postings or copies of job ads, flyers, postings, etc. within a student’s local area;

>- confirmation of enrollment or participation in job search workshops or job fairs;

>- emails or screen shots of job applications submitted for suitable jobs; and

>- emails to demonstrate that they attended job interviews in person, over the phone or virtually.",1592592925.0,2020,2020-06-19,2,fvd5la3,t3_hc2325,t3_hc2325

Same for grad school I would imagine since that's all super individualized. I can't speak to professional programs, but I'd be shocked if they were really pushing for a whole year. That's a lot of revenue to lose, while teachers still need to be paid and facilities upkept. 

I would get in contact with the school first to get confirmation. I would also ask them if they are or can send you a formal letter outlining the deferral (letters confirming enrollment for years/terms are commonplace). After that I would call the help line.

Sunryzen,"I believe the current information provided by the government is incorrect on this situation. As you are a 2020 high school graduate, you are only supposed to have to have been accepted into a program that would start before February 2021 and intend on going.

But currently the government says you may be asked to provide proof that you actually went to school before February 2021. I think they just copy and pasted that from the other sections and it's not actually correct. Clearly the legislation says:

""(b) has graduated from secondary school in 2020, has applied for enrollment in such a post-secondary educational program that is scheduled to begin before February 1, 2021 and plans to enroll in the program if their application is accepted.""

You met all of those requirements at least for the first period. 

You graduated from high school.

You applied for enrollment in a program.

That program was scheduled to begin before February 21 2021.

You planned to enroll (and probably actually enrolled since they already accepted you).

So, again, I think the government is caught up to your situation and their current policy is not correct. Even if you call the Canada Revenue Agency, you cannot rely on the information they give you. Unless you get a written letter from them stating you are eligible for X months, you can't be confident they will not way oops sorry we gave you the wrong information over the phone.

So if I were you right now I would feel confident with keeping my first payment, but any subsequent payments I would say are a gamble. And based on the current official policy, which I believe is incorrect, it seems like they will try to make people pay it back if they don't actually go to school before February 2021. That policy just isn't in line with the law.",1592576003.0,2020,2020-06-19,-1,fvc7zpt,t3_hbs8kf,t3_hbs8kf

chemicalcanon," The reason for being “unable to work” must be related to COVID-19. Such reasons could include being in quarantine or ill, taking care of someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 or taking care of dependants while their school or care facility is closed.

**Individuals in self-isolation/quarantine include:**

* those who have tested positive for COVID-19 or are symptomatic and cannot otherwise physically or virtually attend work; and
* those with underlying health conditions (heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, compromised immune system) who would face increased risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19.

**Individuals providing care to others include:**

* those taking care of others who are in quarantine or sick due to COVID-19;
* those living with someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 (adults over the age of 65; underlying health conditions, etc.); and
* those taking care of children because their care facility or school is closed due to COVID-19.

 

Applicants will be required to attest to meeting the eligibility criteria and that the information they are providing is accurate. They do not have to provide documents as part of their CESB application. However, students may be asked to produce documents in the future to support their attestation. They should keep records to support their attestation at a future date.

**Proof of being unable to work could include:**

* a note from a doctor or other regulated medical professional;
* a notarized letter confirming the reason they are unable to work as a result of COVID-19;
* proof of travel documents;
* emails or correspondence from a child’s care facility; or
* other documentation that provides clear evidence of the individual’s inability to work as a result of COVID‑19.

After 10+ times of calling, I was successfully able to terminate my EICERB claim and sent back the money, but they have an issue with communication between Service Canada and CRA where myCRA account will not update regardless of if I'm able to terminate my claim or not - so I could not apply for CESB.

Last week the Service Canada agent notified me and many other people that their new solution would be to allow individuals to claim EICERB up to $5000 and then stop claiming. They have assured me that the money will not be taken away and that my account will have a notice saying I am eligible for CESB.

Because of this, I have applied for EICERB once again since I've terminated it previously, and I'll be continuing to receive money from them... now I don't know what's going to happen but I guess this was the only option.",1592308836.0,2020,2020-06-16,3,fv04kb6,t3_h9t4ca,t3_h9t4ca

I worked for two jobs and the total “insurable income” is $5100z Do they based the $5000 on your “total insurable income” on your ROE or based on your pay stubs/t4 because I think they are different. ROE includes vacation pay and other stuff. Does that count as an income? I want to apply but I am scared that I maybe ineligible for the benefits. I am also an incoming college student.

However, I don't think that since I won't need CESB any longer than necessary, that other people shouldn't get some financial support if they can't find a job. Not saying everyone, but it's not hard to guess that there are some people in this society that harbor this thought: ""If I don't have access to something or eligible for something, then others shouldn't either."" These people need to get a reality check, because the world doesn't revolve around ""you"".

Many recent graduates may still face difficulties finding a job, and also (especially) disabled people. I think the view that CESB is just for returning full-time students is a bit narrow, recent graduates and part-time students should also considered ""students"" as of now unless the govt. changes the eligibility criteria in the near future. All these people should have access to an extended CESB or another financial assistance program if they're not eligible for CERB or can't find a job yet.

>Individuals in self-isolation/quarantine include:

>- those who have tested positive for COVID-19 or are symptomatic and cannot otherwise physically or virtually attend work; and

>- those with underlying health conditions (heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, compromised immune system) who would face increased risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19.

>Individuals providing care to others include:

>- those taking care of others who are in quarantine or sick due to COVID-19;

>- **those living with someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 (adults over the age of 65; underlying health conditions, etc.)**; and

>- those taking care of children because their care facility or school is closed due to COVID-19.

So if you live with you mom and she is vulnerable to COVID-19 by their definition, you would be ""unable to work due to COVID-19"" and would be eligible for CESB (assuming you meet the other eligibility requirements). You would need a doctor's note for documentation.

If not:

We know that you're not eligible for CERB if you've left your job voluntarily. My best guess would be that it's the same for CESB.

This is the CERB info:

>The Canada Emergency Response Benefit is available to those who stop working for reasons related to COVID-19, for example:

>- You have lost your job;

>- You are in quarantine or sick due to COVID-19;

>- You are taking care of others because they are in quarantine or sick due to COVID-19; and/or

>- You are taking care of children or other dependents because their care facility is closed due to COVID-19.

>There may be other reasons related to COVID-19 beyond these examples why you may have stopped working. However, **you cannot voluntarily quit your job**.

>**If you are concerned about the safety of your working conditions, you should discuss the situation with your employer.**

>If you work in a federally-regulated workplace, you may wish to consult your workplace health and safety committee or health and safety representative as well as the document “Right to refuse dangerous work” at https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/health-safety/reports/right-refuse.html

>Otherwise, you may wish to consult the website for the department of labour in your province or territory for further information on your rights and the process you should follow.

>The Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (https://www.ccohs.ca/) is another possible resource.

Dear_Samantha,"Hello, thank you so much for posting this -- I didn't even realize that they uploaded this backgrounder information, but I'm glad we finally got some clarification.

So I have a question, if I am living with my parents (they are not 65 years old yet) in the same house but they have underlying health conditions like diabetes (mom) and hypertension (dad), would that be a sufficient reason to be ""unable to look for work""?

Because it looks like from this website that individuals that have diabetes and hypertension would fall under the 'vulnerable population' category: [https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/vulnerable-populations-covid-19.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/vulnerable-populations-covid-19.html)

And if this is a sufficient reason, how would I go about getting documentation for this if the CRA do decide to audit me?

I was smart to save my emails sent and the application job bank reference #. But I'm worried since I didn't exactly search for a job for the first two weeks of May but rather prepared to search for one without documentation of doing such since alot of information online and CESB was suggesting doing research and resume revision counted as time used for searching. Due to this lack of information being sent until today about the clarification on the 3-days a week job searching with documentation, is it safe to say so long as I have some evidence for doing this in May and following the guides provided with 3-days a week should I be fine or would this require calling CRA for clarification so I don't have any issues since I don't want to lose this 5k as I need it to survive next year in order to graduate.

Legislation: “ for reasons related to the coronavirus disease 2019 and whether as an employee or in self-employment, they are unable to work, are seeking work and unable to find it, or are working but are paid less than the amount determined under the regulations, during the four-week period for which they apply for the benefit”

CESB Backgrounder: When applying, students must attest that for reasons related to COVID-19 they are:

* unable to find work; or
* seeking work but unable to find it; or
* working but unable to more than $1000 (before taxes) over the four week period for which they are applying

CRA Website: If you are able to work, you must be actively looking for work to be eligible to receive the CESB. If you still cannot find work due to COVID-19, you can re-apply for each CESB eligibility period that you are eligible for.

Eligibility: One of the following applies:

*  you are unable to work due to COVID-19
*  you are looking for, but cannot find work due to COVID-19
*  you are currently working during the COVID-19 pandemic, but your income from employment and self-employment has been $1,000 or less (before taxes) during the 4-week period you are applying for",1591829234.0,2020,2020-06-10,12,ftmvp5k,t3_h0lo0r,t3_h0lo0r

shaynabi,"I can confirm the June 24 date. A CRA agent confirmed this was communicated to them in a memo. She said the CRA will have the ability to apply on your behalf by calling in to override the MyCRA lock out of CESB. I also asked if I could return the EIERB money to CRA and she said no because they would not know what the money should be allocated for and it will cause complications. I also asked “will my open EI claim still cause issued when I call in on June 24?” she said “that’s a good question, to my understanding no. You will be okay to apply for either this period, or the previous period of CESB”. She added, it will be my responsibility to return the money to Service Canada. She also elaborated that you CAN NOT mix CESB + CERB, so it is one of the other for all 4 months of your max entitlement (if you need all 4 payments). This news shocked me cause I was always under the impression you can mix it, as long as you do not exceed 4 total eligibility pay outs. 

I also called service canada and they did not terminate my claim. they said they would look into it 2 weeks ago but no updates. I will worry about returning the money I am not eligible for later, but Service Canada instructed me to hang on to the money until they have a clear method of repayment. I just hope the fact i haven’t returned the money won’t interfere with my manual CESB application next period.

Judegomess,"Same here! Just got off the phone an hour ago with success FINALLY after about 2 months.

So after my call being escalated over 5 times now and many many hours on hold, Service Canada finally created a solution to changing from EI to CESB.

Originally I was not eligible for EI, but applied by accident & was granted it. Since April 5th i've been trying to terminate this claim in order to apply for CESB.

I just got a call back from Service Canada and they explained that they will CONTINUE my claims as EIERB instead of CESB since they believe it is easier ""to go forward, than to terminate the claim then applying for CESB"". I made sure to confirm that I wasn't eligible for this EI that's why I wanted to switch over, and she confirmed and said this is the solution they implemented yesterday (9th). I also made sure to record every conversation I've had with CRA & Service Canada for my own reassurance.

So she helped me complete my 'EI reporting' through the phone and they will be paying me as EI, meaning i get 500$ per week (9 weeks) and i'm required to continue reporting as EI until i've received the full $5000 (same as CESB amount). So I will be technically be receiving $2500 (first $2000 was sent to me already) in a few business days, then the last $500 after i complete my last report.

I hope this helps the people in the same situation as me since its been VERY frustrating.",1591811038.0,2020,2020-06-10,5,ftlthr9,t3_h0cj47,t3_h0cj47

theborderlineartist,"So here's an FYI for anyone who's logged into their CRA account today because of their GST notice and have also been receiving CERB or CESB. 

If there's a notice at the top on your main page stating that you can't apply for the emergency benefit and to call the Canada Emergency Benefits Validation and Identity Protection Service, DON'T PANIC. lol

I did, and called the number because I thought something was wrong. There isn't. CRA has started posting this message as a standard message for when people are logged on but have already received a payment for the eligible pay period. That message is supposed to be different when you log on the day that you're eligible to reapply.

If it ISN'T different when you log in during your new eligibility period, that's when you need to call the number, because chances are they've either assessed your eligibility and have questions, you didn't provide the proper information on your last application, or someone may have reported you through the tip line if you're receiving benefits when you shouldn't be. 

So no need to panic (unless of course, you have reason to from the list above). They've been fronting calls like crazy and apparently that's the confusion. They're just as frustrated on their end as you are on yours.

Pineali,"I don't think most students at all have to be worried based on this particular article. This is in regards to **planning** being done for Ottawa regarding fraud claims for CERB. This doesn't apply to say a student who clearly is eligible for CESB somewhere else in Canada. I'd imagine most CESB students receive the $1250 amount, plus we're only into the second month for it. If you obviously meet all eligibility and genuinely job search while receiving CESB you'll be fine. There's no way the government will start putting students in jail for missing a few days of job search activity **documentation**.

If you clearly didn't meet the criteria for CESB and applied you should probably be worried and even those who haven't done any job searching yet could maybe one day pay it back, but there seems to be a sense of hysteria to all of this in this subreddit that I don't feel is warranted. 

I remember back in April people were saying how they'd be sending students to work in fields plowing farms as a mandatory requirement, when really it was like a single thing one member said during a meeting or something that was never brought up again.

I think the verification that they’ll do on Cesb is to verify that the student is actually enrolled by getting school’s student list. I don’t think they’re enforce the looking for a job because it’s very vague.
It seems like half of students are not looking for a job. (Reddit survey, very small sample but only data available). I just don’t think they’re getting back money from half of Cesb recipients especially claims were well below than expected. 
If they do, they’ll lose those students votes (again, half of college students), politicians don’t want to lose those votes.
If I’m the government, I’ll get back the obvious who don’t really qualify like people who are not really students. I’m not gonna get back half of Cesb recepeints, they’ll be angry and not vote for me next election.

If you still don't know if you qualify for the money in your situation and over time some clarifications are made then you can get retroactive pay for the months you missed so the options are there.

For those of you who are students who haven't found a job you can do, or are qualified for, either for co-op/training/your field of study, then you should collect the money under the pretences that you'll need to collect this money to help pay your tuition along with books/supplies and any new necessities that can range from face masks to sanitizers or additional prescription medications that you need in advance over fear of shortages or otherwise.

If you feel guilty about being given money for not doing anything as just a symbolic thing, as a gesture, or as aid (removing the fact the pandemic is happening and the economy is forever shifting and changing in ways we don't know yet and will last our lifetimes) then know this is the best move for students and the future of Canada. It can seem like people are begrudging you over your efforts but the reality is the economy may open, but its in shambles like no other time

Our biggest GDP trader, the USA, is completely losing it, have barely any proper country wide testing, and are in complete and total denial as to how bad things are getting for them with covid-19, and even if they open up as well, our loss of trade, business, and goods and services between one another will be felt for both of us as well as globally for generations. There is no being kind about this, economists are seeing the writing on the wall and yelling ""get back to work!""(too nearly everyone) because anyone who can work and try to help our economy is seriously a hero right now, because trying to come back from this is going to take longer then any amount of projections you'll hear.

The truth isn't written in the texts books all the time about how bad things really are but things will get worse and you need to be able to pay for your school, attain the knowledge you can to better yourself, as well as live the life your entitled to live as a free Canadian citizen and human being.

setzRFD,"Yes, the August payment, if received in September, would be backdated for August.

Consider this: why would it be so terrible to get three payment or the full four? If you make over $5,600 and you report it to OSAP, it's not like OSAP will take away $1 of funding for every $1 made. I'd be surprised if it was even $0.50 for every $1 made. If it's 50c, for example, your OSAP might get reduced by $1,200 but you would have received $2,400 from the government.

Don't forget OSAP is a combination of grants and loans. It would be beneficial to take $1,000 in taxable government funding than $1,000 in government loans to give an example. You _should_ want to pay just the tax on that $1,000 rather than pay the whole $1,000 back plus interest.",1591493815.0,2020,2020-06-06,9,ft85ej4,t3_gy01nm,t3_gy01nm

>Reasonable job search

>Reasonable job search activities include:

>- assessing employment opportunities

>- preparing a résumé or cover letter

>- registering for job search tools or with electronic job banks or employment agencies

>- attending job search workshops or job fairs

>- networking

>- contacting prospective employers

>- submitting job applications

>- attending interviews

>- evaluating your skills and competencies

>You must be looking for a job every day that you are receiving regular or fishing benefits. Document all of these job search efforts for the entire duration of your claim. This includes the dates, names of employers you have contacted and their contact information, the type of work you were looking for and the results. Keep this information in a safe place.

>Employers do not need to sign your job search form or provide you with a letter confirming that you have applied for a job. You should never pay for proof of your job search and, if asked, you should refuse.

>You are required to make reasonable and ongoing job search efforts while receiving EI regular or fishing benefits. We will take into account the availability of jobs in your community and your personal circumstances when we assess whether you have conducted a reasonable job search.

ETA: I was looking at the language CRA and others have used and they sometimes say $1000 per month and sometimes $1000 per 4 week eligibility period. In reality, employers aren't going to submit anything more detailed than by paycheck to CRA (if they are even asked for that level of detail). Paychecks do not align with the 4 week eligibility period and most are once or twice per month. My best guess would be that they will look at monthly income and will only follow up where someone is making more than the $1000 per month with likely some room to account for the lack of alignment. If you made $3000 in May, you will likely be asked for more info to show income during the eligibility period, if you made $1200, much less likely.

the kind of ""episodic"" they are referring to is things like psychosis, bipolar mania/depression, hallucinations (auditory/visual). **Episodic doesn't mean temporary.**

There are some types of depression that are not chronic nor clinical; they are situational and temporary. (e.g. break-up, divorce, death of loved one, lost jobs, etc). These types of depression are temporary and can usually be treated quite successfully with medication, lifestyle change, good eating/sleeping routines, etc.

Long term permanent depression is hard to treat and impacts your entire life even though there may be days, months, even years where you are not depressed.

You may or may not have clinical permanent depression, but considering you are newly diagnosed, your doctor is probably not ready to declare it permanent yet. 

Your situation is a bit of a grey area with regards to the CESB. So call the helpline and see what they say. Good luck!",1591323529.0,2020,2020-06-04,2,fsxh8b8,t3_gwo0vf,t3_gwo0vf

isometric95,"Since the entire COVID-19 fiasco I have applied for maybe 10 or so positions. None of which I qualified for (on technicalities though, so doesn’t look like I was just randomly applying) because all I could find remotely in my field were management positions that I didn’t have enough education/experience for or other admin positions in medical offices, also which I wouldn’t qualify for. I was hoping to land a student job this somewhere since I’ve almost completed two years, but even with the whole “boost” to the Summer Job program that was supposed to “create new jobs”, there isn’t anything in my area. 

Even when you type in things like “customer service” or “cashier” or even “part-time”, you get maybe 30 results on Indeed when typically you would see pages of endless pages. I have even tried browsing through the government job bank - again, nothing in my area that I am qualified to do. 

I think so long as you apply for a few and have an account on Indeed or elsewhere that can track your efforts (or if you track them yourself) you should be fine. As others were saying, there are likely very few fraudulent cases regarding CESB, since if people wanted to lie, they could have applied for the CERB already which is a higher amount. Cheating the CESB seems almost harder because you literally have to be enrolled in an institution for verification later on which requires a separate tax form.",1591193276.0,2020,2020-06-03,3,fsqxxbz,t3_gvk1yz,t3_gvk1yz

isometric95,"My thoughts on this: 

Because in most of Canada (with exceptions, obviously), COVID-19 case numbers are going down and provinces have been able to begin re-opening their economies, the government has realized that this program is basically unnecessary. I could be wrong, but where I’m from, I haven’t noticed any urgent need from anywhere needing extra hands to do anything that isn’t already being done by organizations that already exist? I dunno. Lol.

They literally mentioned the CSSG as an afterthought of the CESB, and the CESB was very much an afterthought in itself, so... I am thinking at this point it is not going to happen. They haven’t said a word about it anywhere since the middle of April and it is now June. I am thinking they are in the position where most students either have jobs, are collecting CESB and have jobs, and this is just another program to roll out. Also, they never really specified *at all* what any of these volunteer positions would entail, other than using the words “national service positions” to “fight the spread of COVID-19”. 

Like, how more vague could that have been? Ridiculous. 

I think the government could have also been worried that students may have opted to not work and instead collect CESB and volunteer to earn between the proposed $1-5K over the summer for their efforts, so they decided to cut the CSSG out. This makes sense if there really aren’t a lot of volunteer tasks to be done at the moment, I really think it was more of an empty promise by the Liberals to students who kept asking for weeks what assistance would be offered to them. But yeah, I have a feeling the Cons are likely behind this - if students were able to receive CESB and also make money under the CSSG by volunteering over the summer instead of being employed, the number of students who would enter the workforce would be lower (probably wouldn’t have been true, actually, as many students would have seen the opportunity to add volunteer experience to a resume). 

But yeah... likely not happening now.",1591228368.0,2020,2020-06-03,12,fsszbq8,t3_gvhuv2,t3_gvhuv2
fineman1097,"If the 5k was based in volunteering for a number of hours over the 4 months students are messed around because a lot of us have to wait to see what qualifies so are waiting around wasting time we could be volunteering and therefore losing eligibility time for the grant meaning no one will get the full 5k.

Now, there are technicalities and arguments you could make, that do qualify you during an audit, but absolutely nobody here can say for certain whether they will accept them.

1) a medical professional writes a letter stating that it's their opinion that your disabilities were either caused by or made worse by COVID-19 such that you could have worked if not for COVID-19. This would probably qualify you under ""unable to work due to COVID-19."" But that hasn't been tested yet and won't be tested likely until next year. Someone will have to go through the audit process and policy makers will have to decide then what they are going to do. 

2) there is nothing in CESB legislation or policy that says you have to be accepting every job that comes along. There is an argument to be made that you are still looking for work that fits with your disabilities, but those jobs are harder to come by due to COVID-19. So, you can argue that you are in fact looking for work, even though you don't think you can do most jobs because of COVID-19, but if a job came up that worked with your disabilities, you would accept it if offered a position.

3) It's unlikely that being rehired and laid off will be acceptable. It's almost certain that you would be required to look for other work to fill the void.",1590863905.0,2020,2020-05-30,2,fsc24s0,t3_gth31u,t3_gth31u

Prometheus188,"You’re probably getting a cheque. Cheque’s take 10 business days. It’s only been 9 business days as of your post. Today (June 1st) will be the 10th business day. Also keep in mind that Canada post delays due to high volumes can mean you’ll be waiting more than 10 business days.




In order to get direct deposit, you need to have set up direct deposit around 2 days BEFORE applying for CESB. Otherwise you’re getting a cheque.

Thrive92,"UPDATE (June 24th 2020): Hello everyone. For anyone who is in the same situation as I was (read below for that), please call them today and they will be able to pay the remaining $750 dollars. It took me about 8 minutes total to get it in order. Cheers everyone

Heya. I am in the same boat as you (applied for the CESB basic amount, realized I am eligible for the disability amount, returned the basic amount, now im left without answers).

I just called CRA, and the representative told me that up until June 24th, there is no way to reapply for the CESB for the first cycle if you have returned the money. She told me that she will be sending me back the 1250 dollars that I have paid, and then on June 24th (weird random date, but the rep said that is when the system is resetting or something) I should call them in order to receive the remaining 750 dollars.

Keep in mind that this is for the first cycle of CESB only; the second round (which starts on June 7th) isnt affected by this issue, and you should be able to apply & receive the 2000 dollars without a problem. It is just this first round that is causing me and you and alot of people headaches

I think they’ll get back a few like the ones that are not enrolled, but I think if they try to get it back to a lot of students, there will be outrage from students, Liberals don’t want to lose voters.

During these times in my case there’s barely anything open that relates to my field of study (working with children), which leaves retail as the main option only. 

With that being said depending on the store, not all could be considered safe, also for retail stores now it could be a bit tricky to even land an interview over the hand demand of people they are hiring. 

Once September comes I’ll be returning back to university as a full time student so by then a job may not be on my mind. 

Now the media is just bringing fear to us since there are many fraud cases for cerb right now. Students are the last thing the cra has to worry about. With that being said anything is possible. I will still be updating my job search chart but it will not be a burden.

pegasus_y,"why are we even worried about being audited by the CRA, as a university student in QC from 2016-2020: 

-I filed taxes with zero income and claimed those non-refundable tuition credits, all previous tax slips still there and printable from my university student account. 
-i can also ask the university for a small fee to print my official transcript, got so many official documents to prove my student status, i don't worry about CRA asking me for documents
-signed up for indeed, jobbank Canada, emploi-QC. Indeed and emploi-QC can track your job applications so we got a track record to document job search efforts. i only apply on weekdays. 

-just need to use some common sense here when applying for CESB, if you have no intention of defrauding the CRA, what do you need to worry about? documenting job search efforts can't be harder than writing a 3000-word essay... it takes less than 30 min a day to do, just pause your Netflix show, it won't hurt...

Sunryzen,"Interesting link here to Senators discussing CESB:

https://sencanada.ca/en/content/sen/chamber/431/debates/020db_2020-05-01-e?language=e

From May 1, 2020. It includes some language that ca  further help us understand their intentions, though, of course, they can change their policy at any time.

Quotes:

""To meet eligibility for the CESB, Bill C-15 requires that a student be a Canadian citizen, a person registered as an Indian under the Indian Act, a permanent resident as defined in subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, or a protected person within the meaning of subsection 95(2) of that act. He or she must be or have been enrolled at any time between December 1, 2019, and **October 31, 2020**, in a post-secondary educational program that leads to a degree, diploma or certificate.""

Notice she said OCTOBER 31? I wonder if this was a slip of the tongue, a transcription error, or correct to her intentions. Because OCTOBER 31 would clarify things alot. It would then be clear that their intentions are to include all students starting classes in September.

""Lastly, I think the government should reconsider the possibility of including international students, like those who worked in Canada perfectly legally last summer, are still living in Canada and are enrolled in a university program that starts in September 2020. These people live here, work here alongside us, and should be eligible for this program because they are still pursuing their studies in Canada.""

This was a closing statement by someone. Clearly, again, the way they word this shows that their understanding of ""enrolled"" means registered for classes. Specifically, in their statement, anyone registered for classes starting in September 2020.

We have also previously had people link the video of Minister Carla Qualtrough saying specifically students starting in September would qualify (gap year included). So, it's clear that on May 1st, they definitely intended and everyone understood that those enrolled for courses starting in September would qualify.",1590450749.0,2020,2020-05-25,2,frti0vb,t3_gqfzcr,t3_gqfzcr

in the meantime, there are resources available for you if you’re concerned about the safety of your working conditions. if, through your reasonable job search effort, you’re offered suitable employment, you should first talk to your employer.

- if you work in a federally-regulated workplace, you may wish to consult your workplace health and safety committee or health and safety representative as well as the document “right to refuse dangerous work” at https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/health-safety/reports/right-refuse.html

- otherwise, you may wish to consult the website for the department of labour in your province or territory for further information on your rights and the process you should follow.

- the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (https://www.ccohs.ca/) is another possible resource.

basically, if your work place uses PPE and is practicing social distancing, your father can’t be the reason you’re “unable to work due to COVID-19.”",1590423536.0,2020,2020-05-25,2,frs32ri,t3_gpmdwp,t3_gpmdwp

xoNixxxy,"Hey! I don’t have any concrete answers for you but I have ADHD and also applied for the added disability benefit and received it. This definition of disability is very similar to the way other government organizations label it like OSAP/Canada student loan, and universities. I have always been approved for disability accommodation at school and student loan with my psycho educational assessment documentation (I also have super slow processing). I did, however, have to update it last year after my last assessment had been done six years previously. I personally believe that as this qualifies as a disability in other places that it will qualify for CESB as well.

The reason for being “unable to work” must be related to COVID-19. Such reasons could include being in quarantine or ill, taking care of someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 or taking care of dependants while their school or care facility is closed.

Individuals providing care to others include:

* those taking care of others who are in quarantine or sick due to COVID-19;
* those living with someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 (adults over the age of 65; underlying health conditions, etc.); and
* those taking care of children because their care facility or school is closed due to COVID-19.

* I'm working full time as normal, but on a COVID related project now - am I considered to be ""working but making less than $1000""? Or ""unable to work"" because my research takes up all of my time, leaving me no time to work another job?
* Am I even considered to be ""working""? My research would have been my full-time job during the summer regardless of this. It's part of my program so I'm not sure it's even considered a ""job"" for tax purposes. All of the income I earn is non-taxable.
* Does none of it matter because I technically haven't ""lost income"" or been ""prevented from working"" **because of COVID?** TAships for the summer were cut or cancelled, but since I knew I would be working on a COVID-related project all summer I never even bothered applying... how can I even prove that I would've TA'ed if not for COVID?

Basically, I really enjoy editing and colour correcting videos. I want to make an editing portfolio so, on top of the films I’ve helped make in the past few years, I wanted to start making YT videos (mostly for shits and giggles) about this rather obscure little corner of rollerskating that’s had a mini-boom since Covid.

Technically though, I’m building job experience, creating a portfolio, ‘getting my name out there/creating a possible revenue stream for myself’(don’t get me wrong, I doubt it’ll go anywhere but the CRA doesn’t know that), and refining my skills. Does this count towards making myself more employable and thus looking for work?

(I’m still trying to get an actual job for myself but I live in the middle of nowhere with very few opportunities. My dad’s 59, plus he works with a lot of people at risk, and if I can help it, I don’t want to work at a grocery store where I could get covid, pass it to my dad, who then passes it to his coworkers and the people in his care.)",1595264581.0,2020,2020-07-20,3,fyoburp,t3_gp7fzg,t3_gp7fzg

As we know the second period of the CESB is from the 7th of June to the 4th of July. I start work the 22nd of June working Mondays through Fridays. Therefore, due to a total of 10 work days (8 hours each) at $13.10, I’m set to make $1048 leaving me ineligible. Would I get in trouble with the CRA for manipulating my income by taking a day off and only working 9 days (making my income for the period $943.20)??

I’m currently in Spain finishing my semester abroad. Before that (in December 2019) I had two jobs, I quit one and the other one, that’s on my field, it’s a contractual job and agreed to just give me zero hours during the time I’m away, so basically still employed just not working.

Couldn’t return to Canada because I had lost my permanent resident card at the time + couldn’t fine any flights to go back home. But I am supposed to return in end of July, when my semester abroad finishes, and will be needing a job in order to save money for my fall 2020 semester. 


Question is then, am I eligible for CESB? I applied for it and got it and I haven’t touched, but I’m getting short on money here so I’ll probably be needing it soon.

quitethewaysaway,"Not sure what the deal is with “mature students” not being able to qualify, like myself.

On Canada’s website and the CRA website, mature students fall under category one.

There are three categories, you only need to be in one to qualify.

Category 1 is for students who are enrolled in a post secondary program. It doesn’t even state **when** you are enrolled, you could’ve been enrolled before CESB or after.

It doesn’t even say that you have to be enrolled in a program that starts before February 1, 2021. So as far as I’m aware there is no deadline.

Category 3 is the one that has a deadline for February 1, 2021. You don’t even have to be enrolled, you just have to **apply** to a program that begins prior to that deadline (either fall/winter term).

Category 3 is only applicable to recent high school graduate students in 2020. Or mature students if you’re getting your high school diploma.

A mature student who either hasn’t officially graduated high school or is going to write their diploma **still qualifies** for CESB just as long as you are enrolled in a program.

If you are enrolled in a program, then category 3 no longer applies to you. You fit category 1. And category 1 mentions no other requirements.

However, obviously I was not able to work. The organization that was supposed to hire me never formally put out a job posting because they hire based on Canada Summer Jobs Grant, and they didn't know if there was going to be any money for them. This ended up not mattering because they've been closed since mid-April, but it's not great for me because I never formally applied.

pylorie," Hello fellaz, I'm coming up with a little complicated question. To wit, I am a 21 year old student (2nd year). I departed from Canada in the middle of September 2018 after summertime working (above 2 months). I've been working legally through my SIN. Departure was reasoned by the possibility to begin my University studies outside of Canada - in Poland. I have double nationality so it was not the issue to begin so. The difference was that studies in PL are free unlike in Canada.

Since the departure I did not manage to come back to Canada for any holidays etc.

My university went under lockdown on 14th(ish) of March cuz of COVID stuff. Since then I've been having classes through e-learning, that got more intense since May.

The travel agency I've been working at since December 2018, got hit by the quarantine probably the most. It remains closed for now. Right now I'm busy with all that university cuz the exams are coming closer n closer. They're 'bout to finish by the end of June. Sadly right after that I need to complete summer holiday ""apprenticeship"" which is basically 4 weeks at the specific ward. For this year it's GP's office & the Emergency. So I'm turned off for July. The only time I could actively look for job is august.

I haven't filled tax revenue recently but I already updated my data through 1-800-959-8281.

I read all the instructions of CESB & all eligibility conditions. The one I am not sure about is the residency status (as meant in Faq). Becasue I haven't been in Canada for almost 2 years mainly due to my studies & all thing that tie with em. I still maintain my Canadian bank acc, valid passport, a place to live in Canada when I come back. So after this kinda chaotic background here's my Question:

am I eligible to apply for CESB in my state? What to do if CRa audits me?

Oh yeah, the main reason I decided to post it here is that I cannot get through the info line (1-833-966-2099), the other lines work perfectly.

Thank you all for help in advance!",1590519228.0,2020,2020-05-26,1,frwcumm,t3_gp7fzg,t3_gp7fzg

I went through the process of sending my money to CRA (when I was supposed to send it to EI). I really was hoping to make the first period for CESB but I had applied for CERB BEFORE but around the time that CESB applications had opened (so basically the same period as one CERB period and the first CESB period). On the morning of May 25th, I had spoken to a CRA agent and he claimed that he would send my money straight to them (EI) with a note saying that I would like to terminate my case. He suggested to continuously dial the CESB application line and keep trying to apply during this current period. I asked him whether I should call EI for any updates to see if anything went through and he says that I wouldn't need to and that my case would be terminated by itself. Everyday as of the 26th, I kept calling the CESB application line to see whether my case with EI has been terminated since I thought everything was settled by my CRA agent. However, no luck! I am hesitant to call EI themselves because I heard that it is harder to contact them (as did one EI agent, as well as another CRA agent and a few Redditors have informed me of) and they also had no luck with their case when they were able to reach them. What would everyone here suggest? Try to call EI and attempt to terminate my case before the 6th? Quite disappointed that I was not able to apply for the first period. Another concern of mine is that if I call them on their next business day, would I need to wait weeks for them to process my termination claim so I would need to wait a bit before applying for the second CESB period?

,"What do you mean by ""as soon as the instalment showed up in my CRA account"" - do you mean that it verified your repayments? How did you terminate your EI claim? By calling in and asking them to, waiting the 5 business day ?

Did the CRA state some sort of stipulation that repayments need to be fully processed before CERB can be terminated? I've heard of multiple people having their claims terminated prior to repayment of their CERB.

I just got off the phone with a Service Canada rep who said he'd send off a  request for my claim to be processed for cancellation, but didn't mention anything about having to repay immediately...

I'm repaying it regardless, just curious. As there's a whole shitshow regarding repayments, CRA agents are even suggesting not to repay at this time, and wait for more clear information. CESB / CERB are processed between two separate entities: EDSC and CRA.

If you paid back the money to CRA, they're going to have to cross reference these payments between entities. I'm sure it works, but there's a chance things go wrong.",1590179441.0,2020,2020-05-22,2,frhgfj8,t3_goq4o4,t3_goq4o4

FickleEquipment6,"Okay, I am going to say something and I hope I am not misunderstood. Part of the eligibility for the work section for the CESB, was the following: 

- you are unable to work due to COVID-19
- you are looking for, but cannot find work due to COVID-19
- you are currently working during the COVID-19 pandemic, but your income from employment and self-employment has been $1,000 or less (before taxes) during the 4-week period you are applying for

I totally understand being fearful for family, having certain ailments that make you more risky for COVID etc... But, people need to be really careful. If you should ever be audited, particularly if you go the full four months without any employment you could put yourself at risk if having to pay it back. You are literally attesting to the govt' that you need the benefit to make up for work that you would have missed. The government is not stupid, I have been audited before (over something stupid and minor) and the person auditing me was extremely diligent and detailed. It won't be sufficient to make up something at the time. You will need to show proof that despite things opening up you couldn't find ANYTHING. I am not trying to scare people, but I do want people to be smart and diligent. Apply to things that interest you or are applicable to your area of interest, but you should be fully prepared to justify the situation.",1590350025.0,2020,2020-05-24,3,frp38lb,t3_gnw2jc,t3_gnw2jc

meloalien,"100%, I applied for it.

I've been waiting to get in my program for a year and a half, but because it's an in-demand course with a long waitlist, the earliest I could make it in was Sept 2020. I was accepted and paid my seat deposit in November. I've been actively job hunting, but the area where I live has next to nothing for jobs and COVID basically shut down the job prospects and options I had and I've been freaking out about how I was going to afford to move and get everything together by September.

I spent hours looking into it, and I finally decided to just go ahead and do it. I need the money, and this money is directly being used to help me set up and start college because COVID19's made job hunting Hell for me. This money is directly going towards buying my books before classes start, buying equipment I need for classes, getting a room/apartment to go to school, etc - things I intended to pay for with employment income that I am having a difficult time finding because of COVID19. Even with this money, I am still actively looking and applying for work, but this is a massive help that I'm beyond grateful for.

It makes sense to me that the'd want help and encourage new students to continue with their plans to go back to school instead of just letting COVID19 work against them. A lot of people heavily rely on money earned and saved in the months before starting college, and COVID19 has made it extremely challenging for many of us to accomplish this.

My understanding is that we qualify for it (I would not have applied if I believed otherwise) - if I for some reason misinterpreted that, it's on the gov and CRA for being so lousy with their communication. I decided to stop over-thinking it. If we don't qualify, the government and the CRA need to \*\*CLEARLY\*\* communicate this ASAP instead of screwing us around - but the Minister said we qualified, so I went for it.",1590023283.0,2020,2020-05-20,12,fraoqe3,t3_gnksxa,t3_gnksxa

Sunryzen,"Found a new link on the website (still in alpha testing) but it seems to suggest that mature/gap year students would not be eligible. HOWEVER it also suggests that students who started their studies January 1st or are currently going to school are also not eligible, and surely that is not correct.

https://covid-benefits.alpha.canada.ca/en/start

If you go through the questions and say you were not a student for the 2019/2020 school year (dumb because this benefit doesn't require your program to span multiple years, you could literally have completed a certificate program already since January), it won't recommend CESB to you.

The full thing is ""You were a college or university student during the 2019-20 school year and now cannot find work."" 

If you do say you were a student, it will tell you the following:

""The benefit can help if you are in one of the following situations:

Are a post-secondary student or recent post-secondary graduate.

Are graduating high school in 2020 and have applied to post-secondary education that will start before February 1, 2021.""

Notice it says ARE a post-secondary student (as in, currently). Now they are removing the word ""enrolled"" from their language for this purpose. Then they tell you visit the main page to check your eligibility.

So, again, don't be too hung up on this. But it seems clear whoever created this tool doesn't think gap/mature students returning in Fall will be eligible. Who knows how much thought they put into it though. 

Interesting link to keep an eye on anyways. Since it's relevant, even though clearly not completely accurate, still worth to share.",1590094040.0,2020,2020-05-21,1,frdpk7w,t3_gnksxa,t3_gnksxa

Superskull85,"Practise. For interviews your best bet is to research and come up with questions that you think will be relevant to the job. When you have those, go over them and come up with general answers. Have someone ask them to you (mirror doesn't work as well because it's not a person).

When you answer the questions keep your voice level and confident. Make sure you are able to turn your answers into a benefit and highlight of your strengths. Be prepared to provide possible ways you think you will be able to overcome your weaknesses and possibly link it to a strength.

Also, be comfortable with asking interviewers questions and create a conversational tone when you are with them.

As for applying across province, as long as you are able to meet the requirements of the job, I don't see why you couldn't. Perhaps look into regulations surrounding that if you are unsure.

Beyond that, it's really about getting a critical mass of applications out there to give you better chances. But also, make sure your applications are not generic. If you apply to a job think of it as a new paper in school. Just like you don't want your papers to sound the same and use non-specific facts, you don't want your resume and cover letter to sound like you just copied and modified parts.


If you think you are doing all of that then relax. Keep doing it as you are able, but make sure you leave room for yourself too. (Which is also good advice if you're starting your first post-secondary year. You're going to thank yourself later for allowing yourself to relax and keep a level head.)

UnderCookedHuman,"I just applied for OSAP for this fall semester. 

So the question when you apply for OSAP is as follow: ""*If you expect to earn or receive any other income totalling more than $11,200 during your study period (Sep 2/20 to Apr 17/21) (e.g., income from employment, Teaching or Research Assistantships, child support and/or spousal support, foster parent payments, rental income, investment income including interest and dividends) report the full amount here.)*"" Note that the threshold that can affect funding is $5,600 per term.

This does includes CESB and CERB **(but not EI**). However, since we are receiving CESB during the summer, and the application periods for CESB are *May 10 to June 6, 2020, June 7 to July 4, 2020, July 5 to August 1, 2020, and August 2 to August 29, 2020*, we don't need to report CESB.

Superskull85,"Well, #2 should really be:

Make sure you are able to pay income tax from your payments next year. This is a really individual thing based what you may or may not be doing during the year. For example, tuition credits may cover you but if you won't be paying enough tuition you may not be fully covered. You may also be able to cover through carbon tax if not tuition.

Also, make sure you are giving it to yourself. It might be more beneficial to pass it off depending on your family situation. 

The point of this checking is as a precaution. Make sure you have a better understanding of how your income taxes are going to be affected next year. Tax doesn't come off CESB like normal employment income.

Lesson: don't assume you will have tax credits. Make sure you understand and verify how your taxes will likely look before you start investing or spending on non-essentials. Save what you will likely need to pay in taxes (if any).",1589988786.0,2020,2020-05-20,12,fr8yx1m,t3_gn5o8u,t3_gn5o8u

Superskull85,"Out of pure curiosity, how do night shifts affect your online classes? Are you not able to do the content as you are able? Generally speaking, that is how I am used to online classes. The instructor will put out lectures you can review at any time and then an assignmemt that is usually do 5-7 days after the lecture.

So, again out of curiosity, that's why I am asking. It would be enlightening to get a feel of other online systems.


As for your options, I don't think you have many in terms of CESB. Your best bet is to source information through CRA, your local MP, and/or multiple call agents (to crowdaource evolving information).

My guess would be that you be violating the spirit of the CESB agreement that would insticntly imply that you did not act in good faith in keeping up your employment.

However, as a student, it could be argued that you need to make adjustments to suit your education and finding more suitable employment may keep you in good faith.

But this really needs to be talked with and addressed with those working more direct with eligibility. So that's my best advice for you, seek out CRA help on your situation.",1589987700.0,2020,2020-05-20,1,fr8wr86,t3_gn4vns,t3_gn4vns

Okay so I might have something that will give you hope that the CESB's definition of enrollment will allow mature/gap year students. I shared this with a few people but I am sharing it here as well. I did some digging and found this excerpt from ""[Canada.ca](https://canada.ca/)"".

""To get into the school you prefer, make sure to enrol them well before the school year begins."" from ( [https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/new-life-canada/enrol-school/elementary-secondary.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/new-life-canada/enrol-school/elementary-secondary.html) )

Now this is in regards to immigrants and putting their children in school, but look at the language that they used. It's very clear that their use of enrol carries the traditional connotation of being signed up and accounted for. Your enrollment in school is something that must occur before the school year actually begins. This would of course mean that if they're consistent in their use of language, especially since this is coming from [Canada.ca](https://canada.ca/), that anybody that is enrolled for the upcoming fall semester of post-secondary studies before Aug 31st, would be eligible for the benefit.

After finding this, I feel pretty confident that we qualify, especially when you take into consideration that Minister Qualtrough said herself ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpIJIKiNW4A&feature=youtu.be&t=5183](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpIJIKiNW4A&feature=youtu.be&t=5183) ) that gap year students, which would include mature students, would qualify for the benefit. Now they could very well come out and say nah we're using a different definition of the word enrollment and we'd like you to give that money back NOW! Let's hope that doesn't happen...",1589935315.0,2020,2020-05-19,7,fr6xlg5,t3_gmz5da,t3_gmz5da

slckpd,"Okay so I might have something that will give you hope that the CESB's definition of enrollment will allow mature/gap year students. I shared this with a few people but I am sharing it here as well. I did some digging and found this excerpt from ""[Canada.ca](https://Canada.ca)"". 

""To get into the school you prefer, make sure to enrol them well before the school year begins."" from (  [https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/new-life-canada/enrol-school/elementary-secondary.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/new-life-canada/enrol-school/elementary-secondary.html) )

Now this is in regards to immigrants and putting their children in school, but look at the language that they used. It's very clear that their use of enrol carries the traditional connotation of being signed up and accounted for. Your enrollment in school is something that must occur before the school year actually begins. This would of course mean that if they're consistent in their use of language, especially since this is coming from [Canada.ca](https://Canada.ca), that anybody that is enrolled for the upcoming fall semester of post-secondary studies before Aug 31st, would be eligible for the benefit.

After finding this, I feel pretty confident that we qualify, especially when you take into consideration that Minister Qualtrough said herself ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpIJIKiNW4A&feature=youtu.be&t=5183](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpIJIKiNW4A&feature=youtu.be&t=5183) ) that gap year students, which would include mature students, would qualify for the benefit. Now they could very well come out and say nah we're using a different definition of the word enrollment and we'd like you to give that money back NOW!

giltoenomel,"As a self employed person there’s nothing he needs to do immediately but if he has employees then he needs a business account.  He’ll need to register for a business account with the CRA to pay sales tax, payroll, etc. If he has employees then he needs to register for a payroll account. Simple enough to do so not sure why he’s waiting weeks to do so. If you are an employee of his then he will need to deduct EI and CPP contributions from your pay and submit those and his portions to the CRA. He can write out a receipt for you to show deductions (it doesn’t have to be an official pay stub). If you are a sub contractor then you file as a self employed person and prove your income with the required forms you file. There are specific forms to fill out for self employment. However, depending on the job description and what you do then most likely you’ll be classified as an employee (if you do not fit the sub contractor category) and not a self employed individual.",1589889640.0,2020,2020-05-19,1,fr4j2ro,t3_gmi5nd,t3_gmi5nd
Sunryzen,"I guess your buddy is considering you a contractor and not an employee. If you are considering yourself an employee, it's much more complicated for him.

The contract and your bank statements showing transfers are good enough either way. 

But, you also have to report this money on your tax return as self employment income if you are considered a contractor.

If you are an employee of his business he should issue you a T4 slip, but if he doesn't then you would file a manual tax return with a letter saying you didn't get a t4 but here are your bank statements and contract then your buddy would get in trouble...

If your buddy doesn't offer you any actual work they won't let you off the hook for looking for other jobs. 

We don't know exactly what they consider reasonable, but I would guess at least 2 days of work a month minimum or else just keep looking for other jobs.

You aren't going to be claiming any expenses, I guess, just income, so they aren't too strict. They just wanna know what days you worked and earned the money. So if they audit you, you just send copy of contract and print out from bank accounts showing the etransfers or a letter from yourself saying what days you received cash payments.",1589909797.0,2020,2020-05-19,1,fr5jyom,t3_gmi5nd,t3_gmi5nd

HopefulCartographer9,"Hi. I just have a question regarding cesb. I know they said that you have to be actively looking for job in able to be eligible. I used job bank standard account and couldn't find the "" job that interest "" me the most. I used INDEED website and recorded the job listings that i applied thinking that it should count as proof(hopefully).

However, I have a child whos only 1yr old and need to be taken care of . My common-law partner works full-time and I am starting post secondary on September 2020. I know the criteria of eligibility in CESB seems vague but i still apply anyway. I would love to work partime / full time but the case is nobody is gonna look after my son. Not even the grand parents. By the time i need to go back to school on September. i'll think of the way whos gonna look after my child

warriorlynx,"""Auditing"" process would likely be:

1. Upon application check SIN, age of applicant, look for duplicates (or CERB/EI payments made in the period)
2. They will **audit** if there is **suspicion** (e.g. Want to see job activities, proof of claims)
3. They can **review** (which is NOT an audit)
4. Review examples such as checking for those who claimed $2000 by looking at the CCB record (unless they do it already in the application stage). Check your T2202 tax form from previous year or current year. Review is more so done later.

Yvainestardust,"I think people are way paranoid about this one. If you read the actual bill, compare it to the eligibility  checklist AND watch the video that's  been linked in this sub, it's pretty obvious that anyone starting post-secondary in September qualifies. 

All the conspiracies about this make zero sense. Students are expected to work to pay for part of their school year. That's why you have to produce pre-study proof of income. It's why they are waiving the minimum personal amount you are supposed to contribute to your education this year. It's why they doubled student grants and it's why the cesb is a thing. 

Maybe I'm just old enough to be in my give no fuck years, but I highly doubt the CRA is going be ""oh no, no, no, that's not what we meant by enrolled, it's this obscure definition that we didn't clarify in the application.""

I'm old, I was out of work last year, taking care of my oldest with her mental health issues and I'm enrolled to start in September. I registered for classes, but grants aren't paying the bill until September.  I will be getting the cesb.",1589714493.0,2020,2020-05-17,4,fqwqu17,t3_gl963k,t3_gl963k

I applied for CERB and EI (I haven’t been laid off I haven’t worked enough hours for EI not eligible) through service Canada by accident I guess and now I can’t apply for the CESB which I’m eligible for.

But when real life comes rolling, and you have to start actually being part of the inner workings of society, you're all going to realize that every step of the CESB has been...well... unbelievable.

""Any impairment, including a physical, mental, intellectual, cognitive, learning, communication or sensory impairment — or a functional limitation — whether permanent or episodic in nature, or evident or not, that, in interaction with a barrier, hinders a person’s full and equal participation in society.""

There is no list of eligible conditions. The determining factor is that the condition **""in interaction with a barrier, hinders a person’s full and equal participation in society.""**

,"I just wanted someone else’s reassurance because I’m afraid I’m not eligible all of a sudden. I’m registered as having a permanent disability on OSAP, I have the form still to prove that and I revived the $2000 grant from OSAP for people with permanent disabilities. My disability is mentioned nowhere on my taxes - it’s mental health related and I’ve had a lot of trouble accepting it in the past - the only reason why it’s indicated on my OSAP file is because I was placed on probation and wanted to have it appealed. I applied as having a disability because it’s so broad but again, I’m just really nervous. Currently the only supporting documentation is my OSAP form stating I have a permanent disability and a note from 2019 from my accessibilities adviser at my school. I’ve contacted my accessibility services office at my school asking if they’d be willing to share a copy of my registration with them for the winter 2020 session and have also emailed my physician asking if he’d be willing to provide a note verifying all of this. I don’t expect to hear back before Tuesday and suddenly I’m afraid. I believe I meet all of the requirements but it’s always hard to tell with mental health. What should I do?

Maximusloychuk,"Hello everyone,
I was just generally curious about the 1000$ per month (before taxes) statement. 
Is the 1000$ including expenses? 

Example: you're working for door dash and have to pay insurance on your car + gas.

Does this 1000$ include money spent on gas and insurance if it was for my job?

Where are you getting this from? Do you have an actual government source or reason to believe this is the case?

**Yes, you are expected to pay back the money since you did not hold up your part of the 'eligible for CESB'.**

Where are you getting this from? Do you have an actual government source or reason to believe this is the case? 

**The only acceptable proof that we  know of as of now if you have attended any semester including the  upcoming Fall/Winter will be the T2202 form which we should be able to  receive once the term is over/tuition fees are all paid.**

Where are you getting this from? Do you have an actual government source or reason to believe this is the case? 

*Here are some real facts:*

1) The policy for job searching and unable to work has not been written. It is very likely that merely having a fear for your safety will not be deemed a reason to decline job offers. If that were the case, everyone could just claim an unsubstantiated fear with no way to prove or disprove it. Unless you have a government source specifically saying people don't have to make a genuine effort, you are risking making people ineligible by saying this.

2) There is nothing from the government that says you have to complete your term of study in order to be eligible for the CESB. People drop out for many reasons and often don't receive any of their tuition refunded. The idea that someone who gets sick and has to drop out would have to pay it back is not fact based. You have zero reason to believe this is the case. In fact, High School students don't even have to be ACCEPTED to school to remain eligible. 

3) There is no reason to believe a T2202 is going to be the valid proof that they want to see. That policy hasn't been written yet. Students studying outside of Canada don't get a T2202, they use a TL11A, for example. Schools also issue other forms to confirm enrollment for the government all the time.",1589649322.0,2020,2020-05-16,-2,fqtzx44,t3_gklyi9,t3_gklyi9

Typically, there are two formal ways to determine enrollment:

1. T2202 forms. These are tax forms that indicate what terms you paid tuition. They are available wherever you get financial information from your school (usually available online)

2. Proof / Verification of Enrollment letters. You can typically download these from your school online services. If you google proof of enrollment and the name of your school, you should be able to find it if your school offers this as an online service.  

The dates given in the legislation for CESB are students who are enrolled Dec 1, 2019 to Aug 31st, 2020. These dates correspond with being in school last Dec or for the Winter 2020 or Spring / Summer 2020 terms. The Minister did verbally say that students attending in September would qualify.

Not-Icarus,I’m a new student but I graduate highschool last year so what I’ve gathered from what my college considers enrolling is paying a tuition deposit or an enrolment deposit/fee,1589600949.0,2020,2020-05-15,2,fqs8k69,t3_gkkx1w,t3_gkkx1w
Sunryzen,"I just spoke to an agent who said pretty much it is whatever date your school considers enrolled, because if they audit you then you will need to prove it with proof from your school. She specifically gave an example of registration in March 2020 for the September 2020 school year being acceptable, if the school considers you enrolled.

I found an official CRA definition online that says it should have the ordinary meaning of enrolled, meaning registered for courses and having to pay tuition for those courses.

https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-1-individuals/folio-2-students/income-tax-folio-s1-f2-c2-tuition-tax-credit.html#N10678

""The term enrolled is not defined in the Act, but it is to be given its ordinary meaning. In the context of enrolment of a student at an educational institution, a student must be registered with the registrar of the institution such that the student would be liable for any tuition fees required to be paid to the institution with respect to the courses within a program of study. Consequently, tuition fees paid for courses by a part–time student, such as night school courses, can qualify for the tuition tax credit under these provisions.""

I've also found a letter online from the CRA to someone stating that it's whatever the school considers enrolled for RESP purposes, but the link is on my computer and I'm on my phone so cant get it right now.

Hopefully they release a FAQ section soon that directly addresses this so we can all be on the same page.",1589590895.0,2020,2020-05-15,2,fqrse4u,t3_gkkx1w,t3_gkkx1w

She also suggested that I register at https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/ and apply once a month for a job to show I'm 'actively searching'... even though the likelihood of me actually getting hired is close to zero. So I'm gonna apply and see what happens. Worst case scenario, I pay it all back later on. Good luck people!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Looking for some clarification this. 

As a PhD student, I'm currently making $24,000/year through my graduate student stipend (all of this is scholarship/fellowship money... so it's not considered taxable income). 

In addition to the income from my stipend, I usually work as a Teaching Assistant each term (1 term = 4 months) where I make ~$2,000/term (or ~$6,000/year if I work all three terms in the year). This TA income IS considered taxable income.

Since in-person classes were cancelled for the summer, I haven't been able to work as a TA for this term. This means I've lost the ~$2,000 I would have otherwise made over the summer months. However to be clear, I'mm still receiving (and will continue to receive) regular payments from my stipend. 

Do I qualify for CESB based on my lost TA income? Or does receiving continued stipend payment disqualify me from receiving CESB?

mysterycow15,"ATTN: Those who applied to Service Canada first (my experience)

Hi all,

For whatever reason, you may have fallen in the situation where you applied to CERB or EI first through Service Canada. Now, you may be in the situation where you are not able to apply for the CESB because of an existing claim with Service Canada. 

My situation: 
- Originally applied to CERB via Service Canada
- Never received money from Service Canada
- Applied for CERB via CRA website
- Message in CRA account to continue applying via Service Canada (never done that in the first place) 
- Consequently, unable to apply to CESB via CRA due to existing claim with Service Canada

Today, I spent two hours on hold to speak to Service Canada and later spent two and a half hours on hold to speak with the CRA. Hopefully this post allows you to avoid some of that!

At this time, Service Canada CANNOT terminate your claim when you call them to do it manually without starting another claim right away. They advised me that they were sending my case off to their “processing” team to take a look at it. They also advised me not to fill out anything via the Internet Reporting Service. They acknowledged that this means I will not be paid anything for the time being and I may not hear back until May 25 at the latest. If I do not hear back, I should call again.

Then, I called the CRA to ask if they could waive the whole report with Service Canada message, so I could access CESB (which is ONLY administered by the CRA). They said that they were aware of my issue and they had known that it would be an issue with the new CESB. Unfortunately, as of today, they are unable to do so as the system only allows you to apply if you do not have an existing claim with Service Canada. Given that today is also a long weekend, they will not likely hear a response about a workaround until Tuesday. 

Until then, I recommend (from this experience) to wait and be patient until a workaround for CESB is available as they are aware of these issues.",1589583274.0,2020,2020-05-15,3,fqrfer3,t3_gkhpof,t3_gkhpof

How can that be fair and why would they cap it at 1000 while giving out 1250??? My son doesn't wanna ask for a cut in hours to qualify as he would like to keep this pt job into the fall while doing his second year of college...but he could be losing out on 250.00 which is his gas and phone bill...really thou are there any options fir situations like this?,1589753769.0,2020,2020-05-17,3,fqyse2h,t3_gkhpof,t3_gkhpof

I wasn't sure how eligible I was for this first period, but I spoke to a CRA agent over the phone a couple days ago and explained my situation. She said I was eligible, so I applied for the CESB when it opened, but after applying I'm not so sure despite what the agent told me. I have no problem paying back the money if need be if I am not eligible, but I would hate to go and pay it back on my own if I didn't have to, just like I would hate to keep the money (and spend it) if it turns out I am ineligible and incur whatever (if any) penalties are for taking the money when I shouldn't have.

I’m currently not registered for any summer courses and I still have 2 years left to get my degree. The things is I don’t know if I want to go back to university right after this summer during the fall term. I’ve been thinking about taking a break from university for a while because I’m not sure I actually want to pursue a career in the field that I’m studying in. Would me not planning on registering for any courses in the fall or during this summer automatically make me ineligible? 

I also had a job at a grocery store, but quit because I felt that they were not taking the safety of their workers as seriously as they should have been among various other reasons. I am updating my resume and beginning to apply for work elsewhere already. So I don’t think not working will affect my ability to apply as long as I’m still looking for work. Hopefully I’m able to find something during this summer. 

I was also wondering if the $1000 that we can make during an eligibility period is pre or post tax? Thank you for your time everyone.",1589773995.0,2020,2020-05-17,2,fqzs01w,t3_gkhpof,t3_gkhpof

Realistically, most people could work these types of jobs if they wanted to, but if I stay under $1000 a month I will make more with the CESB than I would working 30 hours a week at the grocery store.

Sunryzen,"Keep in mind this may change. It actually doesn't make sense to limit it to 16 weeks of total benefits.

If COVID-19 screwed you out of work for March to August and you meet the other eligibility, you should qualify for more. Nothing in either CERB of CESB legislation says 16 weeks maximum combined.

,"1) You cannot cancel your EI entitlements via phone call, you must only stop reporting, and allow the automated system to waive your claim.

2) If you applied for CERB at all via Service Canada, then there is no way to apply for CESB as it stands. (This is what we're waiting on).

3) The payee for Service Canada has been mentioned to be EDSC, not the CRA - so paying back those cheques to the CRA, could potentially cause more complications. 

Saliently, people who applied for CERB via CRA have been able to apply for CESB despite not paying back their CERB, that means repayment has nothing to do with applying for CESB. They are two completely different funds that will be audited next tax season. 

Best thing to do right now, is hurry up and wait.",1589641574.0,2020,2020-05-16,1,fqtlyln,t3_gkaeol,t3_gkaeol

Melodyyyyyyzzzz,So I worked from May 25 to June 6 and earned less than $1000 but I get paid Biweekly so I would get paid on June 12th which goes into the next eligibility period. So I’m wondering do they count the income on the day you worked or on the day you receive your pay because the days I worked were a part of the May 10- June 6th eligibility period but the day I get my pay is a part of the June 7th-July 4 period.,1591021255.0,2020,2020-06-01,1,fsj19u5,t3_gk8lds,t3_gk8lds

,"I've been contacting CRA/Service Canada about this for 8 weeks now. 

When I first received CERB I immediately called Service Canada to have it rectified, because I anticipated this issue occurring with the overlapping of the two funds. 

I'm ineligible (?) to keep my EI because my RoE ended up stating that I quit. The Service Canada agent told me that I may *still be eligible even though I quit*, so keep claiming EI all the way until the end. 

Yesterday when CESB support staff became available I asked them about this as well, and I was told that it will take  a few weeks to iron out kinks related to CERB repayments and CESB applications. 

My advice would be for now to contact CESB and get enough people to confirm that we will be able to apply for CESB in the future, and that we should stop all claims to EI from today forward with the notion that we'll be covered retroactively for the weeks we've missed while they recede their website.",1589539709.0,2020,2020-05-15,5,fqp9f8k,t3_gk6oxt,t3_gk6oxt

Timbits0422,"I just got off the phone with CRA and that is that they told me: 

(Btw I applied with EI/service canada)
-they don't have all the information yet as this is a new benefit so to call again in 2/3 weeks and they will have more info

-anyone that applied to cerb through EI needs to repay it to Employement and Social Development Canada (check to an address, online banking or institution) NOT through CRA  (I got a bit confused here because EI yesterday told me I could pay it back through CRA but my CRA agent verified with her supervisor and told me that it should be reimbursed to ESDC. I will ask EI again for this tho).

-I will need to repay cerb, however, since i cannot access CESB because I applied through EI (and they have an ongoing process of reapplying the benefit if you fill the reports, or cancel it after weeks of not filling the reports and not right away) it is okay to keep the money meanwhile if I am in a financial need because if I don't, I will be blocked off both CRA and EI until it all resolves which could take weeks. So here it really depends on everyone's financial situation. 

-there are no penalties for keeping the money as long as you do repay it either a) before getting CESB (if i remember properly the money will need to be given back for that benefit but I am having a blank for that question I did not write it down so I could be wrong) or b) if you do not apply for CESB you will eventually need to repay it 

This is what my agent told me. Some agents or other ppl can have different information but this is not from me, this is the information I got calling CRA this morning. Basically, more info will be available in the following weeks and if you are in need of money, do not return that money right now in hope that you will be able to apply right away to CESB, they are still very unsure how this will work as if we apply through EI, part of our profile is blocked so they don't have access to it but EI does. Getting the updated that the benefit is cancelled and repayed could take a long time so if you are in need right now of that money, maybe try and terminate the benefit without paying back the 2000 right away and wait for more info about the transition from CERB to CESB. At least that is what I am going to do, I will call EI again today to see if I can terminate right away and how long it should take to update as well as when exactly I need to repay that money (I do want to repay it all today but I wanna make sure the decision I take won't make me loose all the benefits if that makes sense). 

If you have more info feel free to add as I don't have all info either.  Sorry if there are typos I am writing from my phone and my screen is a bit broken.

My details if they help:
I completed my degree at an international university at the end of October 2019. In November and December 2019, I was not officially enrolled afaik anywhere--although my results weren't released until January. From January-April 2020 I took courses through a Canadian Uni as an open studies student on a full-time basis (mixture of courses that would help with future study and courses from personal interest). 

I asked the CRA if I was eligible, and they confirmed that unless I had a T2202 form from my institution for anytime in the period of December 1 2019-August 31 2020, and that my studies were towards a degree, they would not count. 

(Side note that while I can understand not counting open studies since technically I chose to take courses without formally looking for qualifications, it seems unfair that having finished my degree only in fall of 2019, just not at the standard time of December, I am ineligible, because the idea is that recent grads were still in the early stages of looking for work. Especially annoying since COVID has in fact messed with my job prospects, I was interviewing right before it hit...)

TL;DR your friend can try calling the CRA just in case, but in all likelihood the answer would be no I'm afraid.",1589574864.0,2020,2020-05-15,1,fqqzmlu,t3_gk5b18,t3_gk5b18

The argument that you can volunteer from home MAY work if there is someone else in the house to watch the kids or if you can do it at night. But those types of positions are going to be the most competitive and will be the first positions gone.

The fact is people without kids are getting an opportunity that people with kids(single parents really) are not getting simply becuase of the fact of family status.

FlyingPotatoAmongUs,"Alright here we go. Called the CRA and got the following information:

Context: I applied for the first and second period of the CERB. I returned $2000 dollars already and plan on returning the second $2000 later as I am not eligible. I am eligible for the student benefit however.

Info:

1. CRA agent talked to her senior supervisor and she was told that I would have no issues applying to the first and second CESB periods.
2. They understand that this repayment business is going to be a problem since the applications shown on the homepage do not go away after repaying the benefit. They are working on a fix.
3. When the third period comes around, she said that the CRA should have a better idea on how to handle this situation and should I have any issues, they told me to give them a call.

TL;DR: If you applied to the first two periods, you will be able to apply for the first two CESB periods no problem. Come the third period, and you haven't paid back the money, it is unknown still if you will be able to apply for the last two. If you have returned the money, give them a call IF you cannot apply through the CRA My Account (always try this first).

EDIT: Listening to the call again, the reason the first two are fine is because it is still within the 4 period ""limit"" but the rest are more of a grey area as it stands currently (this is where point 2 and 3 apply).

EDIT 2: Furthermore, I asked if I will be able to apply for all 4 CESB periods if I return the CERB payments. Her answer was yes, but no specifics on how the CERB repayment will be handled to allow for this.",1589481782.0,2020,2020-05-14,13,fqmqfwf,t3_gjmcl5,t3_gjmcl5

**What is considered a disability?**

 ""Any impairment, including a physical, mental, intellectual, cognitive,  learning, communication or sensory impairment — or a functional  limitation — whether permanent or episodic in nature, or evident or not,  that, in interaction with a barrier, hinders a person’s full and equal  participation in society.""

I spoke with CRA regarding the disability eligibility. The agent stated that no documentation is required at the time of application. Should you be audited in the future then documentation supporting the above definition of disability may be required.",1589410885.0,2020,2020-05-13,7,fqjjnei,t3_gj80z5,t3_gj80z5

I finished my first semester of university from January to April and I’m intended to declare my degree once I earn 6 more credits. Where I’m confused is that I didn’t take any summer courses since I’m rethinking if I want to continue down the degree path since I didn’t originally want to do it.

I don't want my OSAP application to be affected in September because I rely heavily on OSAP (from reading some of the posts here it seems to be ok), but again, I just don't want any surprises to come up during tax season or have to repay money I can't. I was wondering if anyone could help me figure out what option would be best for me or what would make most sense.

TheEclipse0,"I went to apply today and welol... their disability thing really threw me off. I’m pretty sure I qualify, but I don’t want to be in a situation where they’re going to ask me for $3,000 back.

Basically, I have a diagnosed reading disability. It is difficult for me to “decode” things. I have the paperwork for my diagonosis so it can be proven... and I’ve received some benefits from my school, including grant money to pay for tutoring (which I returned because my tutor was unavailable), equipment, and I believe (but I’m not certain) a slightly reduced tuition. I used these benefits as needed - which was January 2019. My program becomes substantially easier in later years so it hasn’t been necessary to carry these benefits forward.... however, the disability does not go away..

In addition, I also have a diagonis for depression. I got this about a year ago... I never filled the perscription because of money, and... depression prevents people from seeking help. So, those two things. I have the perscription still, but not the actual diagnosis. I’m not sure where that went, or how I can get a copy if I needed to “prove” it.

The nature of having a decoding learning disability means that it’s still difficult for me to understand some things even when they’re plainly written. I see that the CESB covers learning disabilities... but I am... suspicious all the same, and I don’t want to claim the extra money unless I’m certain that I’m entitled to it.

cursedshojo,"It's nonsense and frankly insulting. 

I was one of those high school seniors who lived independently and paid my own rent/bills, meaning I worked while finishing high school. If the pandemic had occurred at that time, I would simply be eligible for CERB. The reason I am not eligible for CERB now is because I have a much bigger workload as a college student and require financial aid to pursue post-secondary studies full time, therefore decreasing my hours in the workplace. 

Financial aid DOES NOT cover the summer semester for college programs (at least in my province). This means that without CESB covering the 4-month period, post-secondary students would have no means to pay rent, hydro/other bills (including internet/phone), groceries or other basic necessities.  CESB is NOT meant to fully cover tuition or a summer allowance for kids who live at home with their parents and are already provided the basic essentials. 

These kids complaining clearly don't understand financial aid (they're dependents, so their loans will be tied to their parents income). To think 2.5k will put a dent in your post-secondary budget is naive when a 4-year degree in Canada averages 70k. If you seriously think this will negatively affect you, it's time to re-calculate the costs of your upcoming degree and sit down with your parents to talk about family finances.",1589399003.0,2020,2020-05-13,78,fqip5x3,t3_gj5kc4,t3_gj5kc4

I find that the fact that they are eligible for CESB kinda strange. They should be graceful for what they are eligible for, not complaining. 

Being a post-secondary student is a pain of the ass. Student debt, bills to pay, high job competition and stress from keeping up with the school work.

JayManClayton,"Some of them wanted to save up for their potential big move in the summer.

I think the idea behind CERB/CESB is that this is supposed to compensate/help for the money you would have make if not for COVID, meaning *most* high school students in school full time in May-June would not have made as much (at the same time, the 1250$ is 8.40$/hour at full time for 4 weeks so if you work 20h per week at 17$ an hour you might... Or 20h at 8.40$ on two months since this all started...) anyways. But then again, a lot of students have different circumstances.

Many prospective uni students are probably panicking about how they'll pay for their books or contribute to their schooling. Yes, 2.5k is not that much overall over 3-4 years, but in a year? It is A LOT. in a year. Say your degree costs 50k overall on 4 years, it's still like 5%. Per year, it's 20% of your budget. Covers books and a new computer in first year, or a good portion of your food in a year, or helps buying furniture, or a portion of rez/rent, ect. And knowing you may need to borrow 50k, you might want to work as much as possible to get money during the summer and reduce that debt.

So, the ones that did loose their job in March might have already lost up to the amount they can not claim because they can not claim until June. It's a flaw in the system. I am not saying every HS graduate is ""in need"" of that financial help (it's the whole concept of financial help... It's to help... Those in a financial need...). *I* would have not been in need for it between HS and in my case Cégep as I did not work, did not intend to work, and had no plan of moving out (everything paid for, I'll never thank my parents enough), but I came to find out I was the privileged one, not the norm. 

My point is, I can understand that some are indeed in need and I understand the frustration of that population. For this population, it is not a matter of asking too much as they are ""being at home with their parents during those months anyways"" and ""not having to pay rent during the summer"". It's more like ""not finding a job due to COVID even if I search everywhere"" or ""I haven't worked since March and now can't compensate for that lost money"".

Cocopuffs223,I see the point your making but this still screams of ignorance. Not only are you putting every highschool seniors in one circle you are also disregarding the fact that high schoolers have responsibilities. Not everyone is privileged. Ik a girl who had to work to support her family (before any of this was happening) & she used all her money to help pay the bills bc her parents were not financially stable. So imagine now...Not everyone of them lives with their parents. Some were kicked out rather on a  voluntarily bases or not. They have to also pay rent and bills. & another fact laptops are not cheap. Nobody wants to use someof their osap money to buy a laptop. That laptop would cost half of the highschoolers cesb money. Not every high schooler depends or can depend on their parents. Some highschoolers have children also. Not every high schooler buys material things instead of saving. To say they ALL don't deserve it based on what other high schoolers who dont have responsibilities doesnt make sense. .& to add to it not everyone has a car and can afford it. Highschoolers would have to pay for the transit and it adds up. Yes uni/coll students have alottt of  payments that are far more important than a laptop and some transit money. But to use that to basically disregard other ppls responsibilities bc they are high enough of importance as yours....,1589816176.0,2020,2020-05-18,0,fr1aaje,t3_gj5kc4,t3_gj5kc4

,"Went on CRA site and all relevant information is now listed. I find it quite vague though. Pardon my question but I’m a university student and I’m not going to school during the Summer term. I will however return to studies for Fall 2020. I’m 2 years into my degree and the school has record of my enrolment. I can’t register for Fall 2020 courses until early June. Does this male me ineligible? Also there’s a section for Disability Eligibility and what they consider to be a disability (cognitive, learning, mental, intellectual disabilities). I have a diagnosis of PTSD and my school has record of this. However, regarding any tax credits and ODSP, I’m not signed up for either and I’m in the process of trying to get Disability for Students OSAP forms filled out but my doctor isn’t currently working, so that’s proven a bit of a headache.

,"I called CESB today and the guy on the phone said that if you've applied for, or received any CERB you will be blocked out of the website from even attempting to apply for CESB. Therefore, you'll have to wait till end of tax year to have the repayments verified, long after the CESB application are closed.

The gist of it so far, is that if you've received CERB, and end up having to repay it - you'll receive zero in the long run, because you cannot apply for both, and will have to repay all CERB/EI payments.

In a few weeks they may come up with a solution to this, but for now, this is what I was advised.

If that's the case then repaying the CERB is not an advantageous choice on our part, all we can hope for is that we slip through the cracks, or, they offer a deal to repay and reapply.",1589479276.0,2020,2020-05-14,2,fqml79v,t3_gj0j26,t3_gj0j26

Only thing is, once you repay them this way it still takes a few days to process into their system, and then they need to cancel the EI/CERB application you sent in (I was told this could take around two weeks) you can’t apply for CESB until they cancel the previous CERB application.

gregorysibley,"Funny to see my Twitter profile migrating here.

I'm one of the founding members of Don't Forget Students. We've been pressuring the Liberals to get income assistance non-stop for over a month and our petition has about 50,000 signatures. Our group also has developed a lot of backchannel connections with ministers, student unions, the PMO and the NDP. As it turns out, I actually do have quite a bit in the way of inside information about the CESB and the politics behind it.

Everything DFS knows points to a CESB launch on Friday or beforehand. It's good to keep in mind that the government has a lot on its plate right now and constituency staffers are often just as confused as we are given the sheer range of issues they have to deal with. In this case, I think the CA was mixing up the CESB (which is a federal income support measure) with the grants portion of the student relief bill that needs to be put in place more collaboratively with the provinces.  All of this is very confusing for everyone, including MPs, ministers and their staffers.

Minister Qualtrough is on the record stating that the CESB will launch on Friday or beforehand. This fits with everything we've heard by sources in the PMO, the NDP and from relevant cabinet minister's offices.",1589326616.0,2020,2020-05-12,1,fqfknx8,t3_gij7c7,t3_gij7c7

dawn1995k,"God they are doing EVERYTHING they can to not help students. It is insane. The one-time payment given in Alberta (I do not know what other provinces did here) to workers who lost their jobs due to COVID-19 should have been given to all adult Albertans, and the CERB should have been made universal with adjustments in place for students if they so had wished. Now it has become a problem of not wanting students to freeload all summer and not work, as if $1250 is SO much money to live on per month and nobody is going to want to work to live on top of that. Also, they just assume students are lazy and don’t want to work when there are large groups of people on CERB right now who I know don’t plan on going back to work and to continue to feign COVID-related issues for not working because making $2000 to stay home is a way better option than to work and maybe make $3000. 

They are punishing us by mentioning it one day and then saying absolutely nothing but addressing ALLLL of everyone else in that time period and then after a couple of weeks saying it’s coming “soon” still even though apparently we needed “immediate help”. The first thing the government did for students was begin the 6-month moratorium, which does absolutely nothing for current students with active loans. We should have known when this was their first half-assed attempt to make people think they cared that this was going to be an absolute nightmare. I am so sick of being treated like I’m not even a person anymore because I have been focusing on full-time classes for the last 2 years and investing in myself so I can work a job that benefits society.

,"I too am a university student. I wrote a giant post about my experience on EI. 

In 2018 I was working - developed PTSD through an event that happened involving a co-worker (assault). Through the company disability management program, I was denied compensation. I went on EI under Sickness Benefits. There was an attestation that you were seeking work, it was a check mark box. I was on EI for about 12 weeks. They never bothered me about looking for work. I will say though, I was audited by them and ended up being penalized $1000 (taken immediately off my tax return). Also the onus wasn’t on me, I was told by their Investigations Department that “it was how timing worked out.” Essentially I reported correctly (the woman also noted this) and they overpaid me. I appealed the penalization, was denied and by law you’re allowed 1 appeal and if they deny it again, oh well. Sucks to be you. They can and will likely audit people, though logistically a nightmare and will take time. My best advice is wait til the application comes out, really try to understand the eligibility and I believe they’ll have an “information line” where you can ask the CRA agent about your situation and they can clarify your options better. Not deterring you from applying, perhaps just wait til application comes out and talk to them. Very real things will happen and the government needs to recoup that money.

lsdood,"Literally found this subreddit 10 minutes ago, as it **just** got to the point where I’m feeling this is getting ridiculous. CERB was in the hands of those who needed it HELLA quickly - my funds are getting low, I’d typically be working and making money right now. CESB was announced at least half a month ago, and I’ve personally been done exams & without work for over a month now.



I get this stuff is extremely complex to roll out. I understand. I would just argue that there’s people who’ve already received 2 instalments of CERB, yet post secondary students **A)** weren’t making money for months, as they’re in school and studying, and therefore *shouldn’t* have as much money saved as a full time, year round worker **B)**, This is an extremely uncomfortable time for everyone. If all the fucking political parties would stop arguing over how to help us, about how CESB is going to discourage us from finding jobs etc and **JUST HELP US**, that’d be nice.


Lastly, I would MUCH rather have a job then get CESB. CESB is far less than minimum wage. Furthermore, I’m stuck at home quarantined. I’d rather be starting at a job, meeting new people, and being a part of society as a whole.


**Edit:** As I said, I’m now working a full time job making a decent chunk above minimum wage, because while I needed CERB at the time, it wasn’t ideal, and certainly didn’t discourage me from finding work.",1589280101.0,2020,2020-05-12,41,fqd55m2,t3_gi8e18,t3_gi8e18

Simply put, I have a fellow who cuts my grass and he has 100 contracts in our area. He received a call from 10 of his employees, who said, “We are on the new CERB program. We are not going to work for you this year unless you pay us cash.”

Here the Senator is claiming that the guy who cuts his grass had 10 employees all say that they wont work unless they get paid under the table, presumably so they could game the system. 

It's really interesting that 10 employees of the guy who cuts this Senator's grass all informed their employer of their intent to rip off the government when their employer knows at least one person on the Senate.  It's really nice of them to tell someone who knows a Senator of their intent to commit fraud.

ProfessionalCrazy3,"Agriculture work is seasonal, most people wants a full time job that they will do for the whole year, not interested in seasonal where they’ll be unemployed again after the harvest. Also, they want youth since they’re more active, which is better for farm work, most students are in the 18-25 year old range. On average, they’re more active and move faster and will harvest more fruits or whatever than a 50 year old. 
But there is a million students and there’s only thousands farmwork available, pretty sure they’ll get it. But I’m one end, they have to pay like more than $25 per hour if they want a student, government can subsidize $15 per hour or more, but importing foreign workers are much cheaper since you can only pay them less than $5 per hour and they are trained. Also, $5 per hour is pretty good for a foreign worker if they spent it in their own country. In the Philippines, minimum wage was like the equivalent of $10 per day, so that’s like $1.25 per hour. $5 per hour was like 4 times more minimum wage, imagine earning $60 an hour (4 X $15) .

dawn1995k,"Sorry, you focused too much on the rich part of my comment. That really was not meant to be the focus. 

What I am trying to say is that because your family owns and you already live on this farm and are familiar with it, you’re not really in any place to tell people who, like you said may not have been to many farms or are even physically capable of doing manual labour, how “amazing and great” farm work is. Bit of a bias, no? I believe it is a bit of a different circumstance for someone whose family owns a farm and they have grown up their entire life working in that area doing a farm job for the summer as opposed to students who live in cities with no such familial connections and familiarity taking a random farm job for the summer. 

Maybe *your* family isn’t rich or whatever, maybe they don’t take advantage of TFWs and abuse them. Most farms do, though. And that is where the government wants us to step up - on farms reporting shortages of temporary foreign workers, whom they treat like crap and pay like shit. Why would we want to replace that? 

All I’m saying is you’re in a bit of a different position and shouldn’t really be preaching to people about farm work and to support farmers and all this other garbage when your life isn’t changing at all and you aren’t being asked to go work a completely different job than you know how to do and possibly go live somewhere else to do so for the summer, are you?

haileyjaynes,"Hello, farm gal here! 

Farming is a seasonal job! In the summer we plant our crops, bale hay, clear brush, work up fields and get ahead for the winter. 

Raising livestock also happens all times of the year, and no help is ever not wanted. While milking requires training, other things like feeding chickens and ducks, raising veal, etc. do not!

It’s fine for students to go back to school in the fall because they won’t be needed as much then. But during the summer, they can do the easier chores to free up time for farmers to run machinery which no untrained worker, student or otherwise, should be doing.

For labour-heavy jobs, youthful students are the best bet!

I know a lot of people seem to be opposed to the idea of working on a farm. I’m unsure if these people are from the GTA or not, but it really is a fulfilling experience and farmers run this country. Having the opportunity to work on a farm and contribute to feeding your country is an honour!

masonictempleton,"This is a tough question I've been wondering about myself. It would make some logical sense to do that (be responsible for the difference). I know a number of graduate students who applied for CERB despite being ineligible (some in a legit grey area, some who are clearly not eligible and just didn't actually bother to fully understand the requirements) so it is likely an issue that will come up eventually. If it was me, I would not risk it. I don't know (either way) if the benefits could be linked/calculated against each other that way legally. But in my reading of the legislation (I'm no expert!!) the pools of money are entirely separate (as are the applications) and its clear that people will not be able to access CESB after September 30. In other words, you would not be able to apply for and receive the CESB money after the fact so (as I see it) you would be relying on the CRA to create a process through which your eligibility for the CESB could be confirmed after the program has ended and an internal accounting process between the CERB and the CESB to conceptually balance the books. 

Again, I really don't know that much about the technical and legal aspects of how the CRA operates as a government agency, so hopefully someone else has better answers for this question, but it seems like a significant risk given 1) both pieces of legislation are very clear that the debt will be owed if you are deemed ineligible 2) it would involve a significant effort by the gov/CRA and they are not in anyway (I can see) required to do something like that. Sure, maybe they'll be responsible and reasonable given the general confusion about CERB requirements -- but I would not bet on it.

Students are considered to be a huge burden to the government, even though essentially all skilled jobs require a post-secondary education and even jobs that pay *just* over minimum wage require at least a certificate or a diploma.

Also, not sure where most people think nurses, doctors, healthcare workers of all kinds come from - pretty sure you need to be a “burdensome” student to get a job in that field, so I guess the government is saying people should stop going to school and everyone should just be a mindless labourer lmao. Ironic considering how everyone is beginning to appreciate how essential healthcare workers are.

matvil01,">***6*** ***(1)*** *A student is eligible for a Canada emergency student benefit if*  
***(a)*** *for reasons related to the coronavirus disease 2019 and whether as an employee or in self-employment, they are unable to work, are seeking work and unable to find it, or are working but are paid less than the amount determined under the regulations*

Basically, the government hasn't legally stated 'under $1,000' per month. They just said that they can determine an amount within the bill and change it 'under the regulations' anytime that they want. The minister can make changes with the permission of the minister of finance. It's practically a blank promise since they did not write it down in the bill. However, conservatives were concerned about the eligibility criteria so that might be why the '$1000/month' isn't specified or legally stated. I spent a couple of hours going back and forth between the bill and this Reddit thread and had the same questions. Also, it's hard to anticipate any wiggle room when it comes to the CRA, so I don’t think there is any with the $1,000 income cap, unfortunately. 

Students are basically the bottom of the barrel when it comes to the government. They won't care about specific details if it's a problem we have. I'd personally call them and ask them about the specificity of the $1,000 cap if I were you. 

As you saw right now, as far as the eligibility criteria is concerned,  you have to be receiving no income from employment \*with subject to the amount specified in regulations **(which is nothing)\***. This is quite harsh for students but again, I advise you to **call the CRA** and get on the phone with an agent that can answer your questions better.

How is one ""slow"" and the other one ""quick""? It seems longer because we are waiting so impatiently that time goes by slower.

EDIT: Just to add some sources, Bill C-13 (CERB) passed on March 25th and the application opened on April 6th. On the other hand, Bill C-15 passed on May 1st and it is now May 11th. One reason it may feel slower is because this bill took longer from being announced to passing, which is a fair thing to mention but as far as bill passing dates go, they're pretty much on par for pace.

First of all... the government decides who gets the money. They make the criteria. Not you.

Second of all... it’s their money, not yours. Let them make their own financial decisions. This is a bad time, you don’t need to be on the internet griefing others.

Honest to goodness, people who are claiming the CERB are not enduring this level of drama and crying and moaning about whoever gets the benefit whenever they feel that the other person doesn’t “deserve” it. Those people filled out a forum and got the money. End of story. I’ve seen a lot of wealthy people who actually don’t need the 2k just invest it into stocks. If they can do that then students can too. Why hold students to a higher standard? As a matter of fact, even if someone said “gee, I have enough to pay the bills for the next 12 months, I shouldn’t take the CESB” it would still make sense for them to do so because most likely they have a huge amount of debt.

you may also register your disability with the federal government by applying for the disability tax credit, which is a non-refundable tax credit that helps persons with disabilities reduce the amount of income tax they may have to pay. you can read more about eligibility requirements here: https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/segments/tax-credits-deductions-persons-disabilities/disability-tax-credit.html",1589154542.0,2020,2020-05-10,2,fq7y1lb,t3_ghc8v9,t3_ghc8v9

1. Pay off credit card debt (if any) 

2. Put $1,000 in Emergency Fund that you’ll never touch (Tip: open a new bank account on other institution

3. Pay yourself $1,000 and it’s up to you whatever you want, just don’t exceed that amount

4. Save the remaining $3,000 or less in pure cash, don’t worry losing 2% on inflation, you have to have experience investing first. Only invest around $1,000 in the stock market first. That way, you’ll gain experience, and if you lost half of it, go back to your investment and see what go wrong and learn from it. After a year, you’ll be much more comfortable investing the market with larger amount of cash, don’t put more than $1,500 in the market if you’re a beginner, gain at least a year of experience, Experience in the stock market is much better than buying any stock market courses, there are a lot of YouTube channels teaches the basics of stock market, just don’t buy their course as there is no “cheat code”.",1589149988.0,2020,2020-05-10,11,fq7q7m2,t3_gh5jav,t3_gh5jav

CanadiansMatter2020,"With respect to those who do not understand. I don't think you can comprehend the gravity of how hard it is to survive this pandemic. With no funds at all, and being two months behind in rent. I believe it's important to realize as an adult taking grade 11 and 12 level 20-1 and  30-1 high School course's I am very busy even as a part time student. I get good grades and finished some of my level 30-1 courses. Most people take -2 level and are moving on to lesser educational aspirations. I have my educational load and am as hard working as any University or College students who are working towards a degree. I would also like to add with my current level of high school education, I qualify for most types of degrees but aspire for Medicine. I have to work harder then the average person. I do not feel this is fair. I will most likely be homeless at the end of the month because of this. No money, no programs to help me and I can't qualify for anything. I'm still in school, it is the only thing keeping me grounded is doing the work. I am a bodybuilder and physically very strong, but I have never felt so helpless in my life. I'm afraid I will fall into the system of homelessness soon and get Covid-19. I believe in Canadian democracy, and I appreciate Pierre Trudeau's contributions historically. But, I do not think he would have left out students like myself if he were still alive, and he would have protected the seniors, people who have given so much in life and deserve more then a mere $500. I had high hopes for Justin Trudeau, in Social Studies 30-1 I would often talk about him and his modern liberal government, because I trust in his father's reputation, yet it is the corporations that are benefiting from this pandemic. Canadians, if the don't qualify for CERB or CESB, are dying out here in the real world. This is how democracy falls for most of us, with thunderous applause, and allowing for these sorts of violations of human rights, by choosing who gets saved. There are hard working students like myself who will incorporate a lot in the near future if given the chance to survive. I want to be a doctor, I have good grades and I'm on track. I'm not going to compare my aspirations to what others may see as lesser sure there's others who want to be veterinarian or store managers but medicine is my goal. Please understand that this is not fair, and these are extraordinary circumstances, as Canadians our government must recognize our needs now they have left us out to long and I'm losing my home soon. Throughout history the government has donated billions to NGOs, and pleasing corporate interests. All Canadians need help especially the poor. I'm Catholic and I know that if Jesus was alive he would not have qualified for CERB or CESB. This is a real shame that will reflect Canada's character to the future during this pandemic.

You need to be actively working to “stop” something. How can you stop working a job if you haven’t started? Going based on your criteria, anyone can qualify for CERB because they planned to work. 

Besides CESB was specifically created in part to cover students who has summer positions cancelled due to COVID. They actually had a line in the original CERB FAQ saying that students who didn’t start a summer position didn’t qualify (but I guess that’s not needed anymore as they updated everything to say stopped working and made CESB)

sadrapsfan,"Man, that minister really fked up when she said if you decline, you are out fo the program because it created this massive misinformation.

No one can force you to work at a farm, that's unethical. Moreover, the amount of demand of labour at farms is SIGNIFICANTLY lower then the supply (there's literally over a million students applying to cesb according to estimates). C


Conservatives talking point were stupid, I mean this dude thought that restaurants were out there asking for help? Like really when half shutdown and let their employees go? There are thousands of servers across Canada that have no job but yea, restaurants are freaking out because they have no help? Students with no Kitchen experience arent helping no one and if those places wanted, just move waiters and servers to the kitchen instead of firing them.

The government simply can't force people to work, they can ask us nicely to look but many people keep forgetting, this fund was created to help everyone affected.

I mean I have no doubt u were looking for a job before this went down, but if you change your mind now, there is no fault on you. Why should you still seek work when the govt quarantined us for 2 months and now magically it's all better now?

SleepyQueer,"I'm very anxious about this as well. I'm disabled and can't drive and even at the best of times almost never manage to find summer work. The last couple of years I've signed up for courses as a backup and then looked for jobs just in case but haven't been able to find anything in 3 years now, and my only criteria to apply are ""must be able to get myself to the workplace"" ""must be able to physically perform the job"" and ""job must be something I even sort of kind of have a relevant skillset for or else could learn quickly"". This year when co-ops and summer internships/jobs were being cancelled en masse in Feb/March, I was like ""welp guess it's summer classes then"" because even though I really need some income the writing on the wall was pretty clear and at least earning some credits would help a little. Taking a full academic semester means I have one less semester of rent to pay down the line, which is a bigger expense for me than tuition. To not actually take a massive financial hit any job I got would have to cover not only my rent for the next few months, but also the extra 4 months rent I would have to pay down the line to take those credits later. Finding a job that pays that well that I can actually do is less probable than finding a live unicorn in my backyard, and frankly I don't need the stress and distraction of having to make a show of job hunting while trying to get through my 6th straight semester of classes while my health is in the toilet because I'm deconditioned after having surgery in January and haven't been to physio which I need to manage my chronic pain since before my surgery. I just don't have the energy to spare to even pretend while my burned-out dysfunctional body desperately tries to keep up with classes. Past a certain point though I can't drop out of classes to take a job anyways without blowing a semester's tuition and having a bunch of ""WD"" on my transcripts, and my health has never allowed me to do work and school at the same time. And I'm worried about the criteria that they'll use to determine disability status because if it's DTC rather than eligibility for federal grants for students with permanent disabilities, I (and many others) are a little screwed.   


I truly hope that the requirements here are minimal to prove job-seeking. And I hope they make reasonable exceptions for people who are disabled, have dependents, live with someone they might y'know... kill if they brought it home, or maybe aren't disabled in the usual sense of the word but have conditions that make them high risk (like asthmatics, diabetics, immunocompromised folks, etc.), are taking a full-time courseload, etc. Even with CERB we're already seeing concerns about people not being able to refuse returning to work in unsafe conditions or not being able to leave their unsafe jobs because they won't qualify and thus can't afford to. There are a lot of reasons why someone can't or would be reticent to go on the job market right now especially with how many employers are too often poorly handling things and I don't think they're all being well-accounted for by the folks making the rules. Meanwhile the administrative burden of having complex sets of conditions to meet across an awkward patchwork of programs costs the government a lot of money too, while leaving a lot of people stranded, and that bothers me. With all the challenges we've seen with CERB and so few details being released on CESB I don't think it's fair to be dismissive of people who are worried about the criteria or are upset that students have been singled out to meet extra expectations that other people don't have to meet.",1589140058.0,2020,2020-05-10,1,fq7040m,t3_ggpbys,t3_ggpbys
,"CERB is not meant to be perfect but I sure am sick of people trying to shame CERB recipients as if they are lazy or carefree! I am not getting a hand out. I paid the government way more in EI than Ill ever get as Ive never used the program ON TOP of my insane taxes. Now I am stressed because ill owe a whole bunch of taxes for CERB thats more than some McDonald worker who normally nets $500/month. Do you think I want to live off of \~1500 a month? Thats living carefree?! 

Ill also keep less of my pay check when I go back to working as EI will have to take their cut for 2020 DESPITE me being FORCED on CERB instead of EI (which would have given me several hundred dollars more per month due to my contributions!). Guess I'll have to swallow having to pay more taxes next year as I don't know how they are going to fund all this money. I don't even get the option of not returning to work as that would make me ineligible for CERB and EI.. so you can't just sit at home and ""protect"" your love ones. 

I am tired of seeing all these ""falling through the crack"" stories when its self inflicted. You had several months notice to find a new job but you decided to pick what worked best for you. Now you want the tax payer to pick up the pieces because you don't feel like ""exposing"" your loved ones to what exactly? How many people are dying that aren't extremely high risk? Oh wait, not as much because we HALTED everything to help them. Work places have safety features and the hospitals aren't overloaded. All the sacrifices people have made have ACTUALLY resulted in a positive outcome. So don't spit in their faces by throwing around a death sentence just for some flimsy argument for some self indulgent post.

You're literally crying about not being eligible for something that doesn't even have an application or an FAQ. Do you think the government is going to strap you down to a truck and ship you to another province for work? Do you think you won't have some freedom in picking a job that works for you? What if there is one you can do from home?

matvil01,"As for QC, high school ends in Grade 11.  I totally agree that university students need to be able to afford basic necessities as well as tuition more than high school graduates. Even though I am a CEGEP student, I still have to pay for transportation, textbooks, and classes just as much (Obviously not right now but the money should help fund my next 2 years). As long as you're enrolled in a post-secondary program any time between December 2019 and August 2020, as far as the eligibility is concerned, you should apply for May-June-July-August.

&#x200B;

I don't see any high school students graduating before June so as far as technicalities are concerned, it says ""**has graduated from secondary school in 2020"".** This is the past tense, hence you must have graduated to be eligible. So I guess if you ain't graduated yet then you're not eligible. But I have no idea how any High School students are gonna graduate if there are no ministerial exams. It barely makes any sense.

Don't stress too much about technicalities. The worst-case scenario is you get audited so if you claim the benefit, make sure you spend the money on basic necessities that require your life to function no matter where you're at as a student so that you can tell the CRA I claimed it for {this reason}. Not hobby's or luxury items. So if you want to apply for May go ahead, like I said the worst-case scenario is you lose $2,500 out of that $5,000 considering the eligibility criteria.

Here's the eligibility as for the bill hope it helps

Does this mean that if you have a disability or a dependent, you can only receive the $2000 for one of the qualifying periods, and only get $1250 for the other ones? That seems a bit unfair if that is the case. 

I know I will also likely get torn apart for asking this, but due to mental health issues I gave my psychiatrist consent to release any necessary medical information if I needed to access for example, income support.

,"I think in the technical sense as an employee of an employer,  you don't actually have the final say over your work schedule.  It's the employer who has final say based on whatever new hire agreement or job promotion documents you received which usually indicate if you are casual, part time, full time, guaranteed hours, etc...

The employer is the one with business hours and they schedule you in to fit their business needs.

Therefore legally you are not in a position to demand certain work hours or any schedule.  You can offer input, and then the employer can juggle that input with their business needs and other employees, but it's not legally your call.  It's their business, not yours.  They're in charge, not you.

So when you offer your employer input about your availability for whatever reason (in this case it's Covid-19), they have the option to keep you on and accommodate your request, or not keep you.  Most times they keep you and schedule you in an accommodating way, but it's not really your call.

Knowing that this is Walmart, you were probably hired as a Casual... Or part time... If you are guaranteed 15 hours a week and then ask to reduce to 8, then there's an argument that it was voluntary .  But if you're working your 15 hours/week, and they are constantly asking you to work additional hours which make it as if you are a full time employee and then now because of Covid-19 are going back to the original 15/week, then you're not reducing your hours..  In this case, you are affected by Covid-19, and your simply not working additional because that's not what you signed up for - yet still working the 15.  If they want you to work more hours consistently, then they need to upgrade your status within the company and give you a new contract that says full time or 25 hours etc....  Then, in that case if you reduce hours as a request and they accommodate, I'd say it's voluntarily... 

If your case hits review, i think the deciding factor will be was it a voluntary reduction of work, and i think your new hire documents and any other documents that indicate your expected work hours (something generally that has either yours or a manager's signature), will be the evidence used to decide that.

In essence, i don't think you can volunteer to ""reduce"" your hours, if you were constantly ""volunteering"" to work more than whatever is in your new hire documentation..

I suppose I'm obligated to say your mileage may vary.. Use my input with due diligence and caution.

Usually you will find this out when you receive your Notice of Assessment, either as an electronic notification or in the mail.

1) Postal code is sometimes incorrect, meaning you might have an older address on file (call us to get it sorted out, use postal code of old address for the time being).

warriorlynx,"1. A job bank is good, especially for new graduates who could get matched into their field would be a dream come true for some, it's how it's going to be executed that worries people. 

2. Our country transitioned into a knowledge-based economy in the 90s (and now a gig economy), Canadians aren't used to farming work or are we trained, or prepared for it, which is the reason why we bring in temps to do the work we don't do.

3. The unfair part comes in in that CERB recipients are not being asked to work, it creates a class warfare. A 15 year old who used to work part-time and earned more than $5000 in 12 months can make $2000 and would likely want to stay home for the remainder of the benefit term.

4. Also some feel it's too risky to work in May (eg. ON is still in a lockdown for all of May) because of covid-19, otherwise there are plenty of grocery retail jobs available.

OpossumExpert,"There are health risks depending on what job you “have” to take. Also a lot of students don’t drive but take public transport, and  in a lot of places right now public transport is closed. Also there are students who are single parents who cant just go out and start working a low paying  risky job (like farm work) right now especially because of the pandemic, even working at a cash register is risky because there is a possibility you’ll bring the caronavirus home. Also the fact the they didn’t force this upon the people who are getting CERB is disrespectful. They are also people who can go out and work and most of them are probably more qualified or more capable of doing certain jobs. Also a lot of students right now are taking summer classes online, if there wasn’t a pandemic they would have the opportunity to work at their school where it is easier to go to work after and between classes but right now everyone is home. Those are just a couple reasons I thought up that explain why people are angry.

Edit: A lot of students had summer jobs lined up for them that couldn’t happen because of the caronavirus so that point that you made about CERB doesn’t make sense",1588621036.0,2020,2020-05-04,7,fphgtwn,t3_gdi3jr,t3_gdi3jr
Krauss_,"I had a full-time summer job lined up and I'm still employed (although my hours have been reduced to zero) by my employer. Because of this pandemic, my workplace (amusement park) has been closed until further notice. I'm not eligible to the CERB because I'm a seasonal worker who don't qualify for EI benefits (I've met all other requirements for the CERB except stopping work due to Covid 19 - I stopped working because our season ended last year). As a full-time student, this makes the CESB the only support I can rely on during this summer. I could look for a job in a grocery store or in another essential work field, but that would mean exposing myself to the virus which would be fine if there was no chance I could transmit the virus to my immunocompromised mom and asthmatic little sister. 

What's unfair about asking people to work as a condition for the CESB? Not everyone can work during a PANDEMIC, which is still ongoing and has no treatment for it. Personally, I'm still going to look for work I can do from home like online student tutoring and other kinds of work I can do while keeping my folks safe. I'm not looking to take advantage of the gov't's help measures by staying home and doing nothing - I'm sure a lot students feel this way as well. But throwing students into a meat grinder (the pandemic) is NOT a solution here. There are still a lot of new cases going on in Canada - particularly in Quebec, Ontario, BC and Alberta. For students who live in these provinces, asking students to work to get the benefit can be too much. We already know this disease affects all groups of people. The last thing students need is to be forced to go out and work under pandemic conditions and to infect their friends, room mates and loved ones at home.

If a student is in a position to work and there's nothing that is stopping them from doing so (like me if I can get work I can do from home) then yes, students (and everyone else) should go out there and get work. Otherwise, students should not lose eligibility for the CESB because their situation prevents them working. I don't believe students are inherently lazy. We go through rigorous years of studying to earn our degrees, masters and PHD's. Lots of students would go out there and work under normal conditions because we have bills to pay and tuition to pay this fall. Given that most summer jobs have been cancelled and given the current condition we are in during this pandemic, students need support now more than ever.

Thanks for reading this and hopefully this shows folks why its unfair for students to be asked to work during this pandemic.",1588625182.0,2020,2020-05-04,2,fphp1bw,t3_gdi3jr,t3_gdi3jr

ThunderBack,"I feel like theres a bit of entitlement going around. Sure, are there anecdotal situations where CESB doesn't help? Is CESB flawed in general? Yes. But I think just looking for work as a requirement for a benefit is something easy to do. And if someone is in a situation they cannot, like they have a child, then I understand and they do require more assistance.

This benefit is designed to help people who expected to work, but due to Covid, it has become a lot difficult to find work. For those of you who are scared to go to work and feel that is a justification against a job bank, it isn't to the government. For CERB, people who voluntarily quit there jobs or refuse to work due to safety concerns for themselves or others aren't eligible. 

I don't think people should be working on farms. I highly doubt mass students will be on farms. But for a benefit where employment isn't a requirement, I think requiring people to at least to attempt to find work is fair.

As much as people on this reddit complain, the majority of students will be content with the benefit. Either they weren't intending on working in which case they can get money for no reason. Or they are desperate for work in which case they are going to seek it out benefit or not.",1588624950.0,2020,2020-05-04,-2,fphol33,t3_gdi3jr,t3_gdi3jr

mike_s179,"Hey, first off, congrats on the award, I know how competitive they can be! The CGS-M is usually reported as scholarship/bursary income, and is not taxable. It is separate from “employment income”, and likely wouldn’t fall under the cap of $1000 per month that the Minister set for these benefits. 

The bill C-15 which was signed into law on Friday says that “any other income that is prescribed by regulation” is prohibited to be received. We don’t know yet if this will include non-taxable scholarship/bursary income, reported on T4A slips. Most likely not, since then bursaries received through Canadian/provincial student loans would make many students ineligible, but we will know once applications open up for sure.

That being said it's rarely enforced (and that's not necessarily a good thing, I have met and/or lived around many people who have abused social assistance for years.)

I would be extremely surprised if this is any more than a finger wag telling students to seek employment and accept any offers they're successful in getting. Again, not necessarily a bad thing, as I think most of us would accept job offers if they are given and we are capable.

I think things were conflated between the Job Bank and the requirement to accept a job offer. The latter of which isn't a new concept on its own.

My issues with this whole process are simple. I think it's ridiculous that it took so long to get this benefit started, and now we are in May still awaiting information. On the other side of the political spectrum I am insulted by arguments and rhetoric used by some MPs and Senators. I said this a few days ago, but I'm pretty disappointed in our government as whole.

That being said, we are in a pandemic and I'm happy that assistance is coming to many that need it, even if it's not perfect.

However, the concern lies in the future because the minister and the liberal gov't are allowed to make changes to this bill as they see fit. Couple that with Minister Qualtrough's comments during the senate hearing for CESB and the conservatives and the liberals' lack of concern for students getting infected while working, it's enough to make those of us who want to work but are unable to because we are either at high risk or our loved ones at home are at high risk very concerned about our eligibility for the CESB.

TLDR: She wants students who refuse job offers to be disentitled to the CESB. She also wants the eligibility for the CESB to more rigorous than that of the CERB to prevent people from being disincentivized from working (while neglecting to say that we're in a pandemic with a disease that has no cure or vaccine and that there are a lot of concerns about getting infected - just look at meat packaging and processing plants in western Canada for example. Hundreds of workers being infected. Same with grocery workers all over the country.)

Kitew,"Cleaning up my post here:

The bill claims that students need to attest that they are looking for work. **No enforcement**, simply a redirect to a job bank page with suggestions and emails with job offers.

The hearings happen and things are said that confuse us, the students, regarding if we can just claim the CESB without actually looking for a job or going to work.

Confusing things were said SOLELY to appease the conservatives that were pushing very hard for labour from students.

HOWEVER, the bill passed WITHOUT CHANGE, so the only thing that will happen is that we need to attest to that we're looking for work with a page redirect to a job bank, nothing more.

Hopefully that clears up confusion, because the bill is very clear on it. Just remember that it doesn't matter what was said in the hearings, only what the passed bill says.

EDIT: Attest meaning we click a checkbox, very simple.

The only requirements on the legislation is that you must be a student, be unable to find a job due to COVID, can only earn a certain amount of money, attest that you are looking for a job, and don't receive certain benefits (like the CERB for example). That being said, I believe that the Minister of Employment and Social Development will have the final say over the precise eligibility requirements.

Krauss_,"This is the part of the senate hearing when Minister Qualtrough said students will not be eligible for the CESB if they reject a job offer:

""Ms. Qualtrough: Thank you for the question.

I do worry about the things you’ve mentioned. We included certain measures in the bill, such as the attestation. Students must pursue any job opportunities that arise, and they must look for a job. If they don’t look for work or don’t accept a job that’s offered to them, they are not eligible for the benefit. That is why we created jobs through some of the measures we introduced last week. What you’ve said really concerns me.

I understand what you’re saying, but we need to strike a balance between meeting the students’ need for assistance and ensuring that they are not deterred from working.""

I only added this here so we all know what she said and what she maybe intending to do with the CESB bill (in terms of amending it) in the future.

While the CESB passed without amendment, her comments were concerning because it neglects those of us who lost our summer jobs due to Covid-19 AND are also living with people who are high risk and/or are at high risk ourselves. These comments could mean that we may have to enter the workforce under pandemic conditions and risk infecting ourselves and our loved ones at home just so we can receive this benefit.",1588448423.0,2020,2020-05-02,2,fpahqt7,t3_gc69cr,t3_gc69cr

Therefore, if you are taking classes, or have other reasons to work select days and times or part time then these jobs wouldn’t be suitable for you. So it seems that students can avoid being matched to these jobs if they can’t work full time or have select availability.

The people on CERB already tried and were forced home. Its not like a student cannot find a job and get laid off.. and then not qualify for CERB? 

Obviously the type of students on CERB are way ahead as they get more money as they typically would have made less/around the same during the summer anyway. The average non student (most of the people on CERB) are in a different boat. They have more bills and responsibilities (on average) AND pay more in taxes. They have also paid the government years/decades of employment insurance ON TOP of their taxes. So they have paid the government twice as much money and will get to keep less money. A student on CERB gets to pocket more of the 2 k, while a regular CERB user gets 1500-1700 because of their income bracket once they return to working.

cesblol,"I think you are really being tone deaf to the issues. Here's a few to consider:

&#x200B;

\-Students are still in school, the jobs they may have taken in the summer before may have been very specalized to their field. They may have found part time work at their schools which would have worked around their schedules.

&#x200B;

\-Some students lost entire work terms, which may have paid for 2 semesters worth or more of tutition.

&#x200B;

\-Some students have disabilities.

&#x200B;

\-Some students are high risk and can't risk exposure.

&#x200B;

\-Some students live with elderly or high risk people.

&#x200B;

\-Some students were self employeed who made low income but do not qualify for CERB, now they can't work.

&#x200B;

Saying if we really needed the money we would work is not entirely true. A lot of us would simply not go back to school in the fall if we could not afford it. The reality is some of us cannot work because of COVID-19, a lot of us can't. Could we take a work at home job? Yes, but how many of those are hiring right now? Almost none. Working under many different conditions it not an option for many students right now, and it is directly related to the COVID-19 epidemic. 

&#x200B;

Side note, I disagree with your general premise calling future / current engineers, doctors, cs grads and so on lazy for not wanting to work at a farm. They studied hard for many years and it's just pretty insulting. If this is your logic, cerb for sure should include the same requirements, but it clearly does not.

One, I don't want to be out in public, putting myself and (especially) my parents at a higher risk of getting sick. I would much rather have a job that would help me develop my skills and make connections in my field than be stuck at home thanks to a global pandemic. 

Two, many of the available jobs (ahem, farming) won't help me learn about my future career, and the pay is simply not worth the risk. 

Three, I've signed up for summer classes, figuring that I wouldn't be able to find a meaningful position to match my skills. I'm glad I did that, seems I was right.

Pineali,"Reading more into the site with info I’m actually getting a lot more concerned now than I was the entire last week about this. 

“According to Minister Qualtrough, you will not be forced to take a job, but you must attest that you aren't refusing jobs and are looking”.

Maybe I’m reading this wrong but don’t these things mean the same thing? It’s like saying you won’t be forced to take a pet, but you must attest that you aren’t refusing pets? Like is there a way where you accept a job that isn’t actually taking it? I’m so confused by this. It’s saying “I’m not forcing you to eat a burger, but you must confirm that you aren’t refusing burgers and are actively seeking for burgers”. 

Trust me I think this could actually be an amazing system that finds some great jobs for the area that I want to get into and I’d gladly work a full time job through this in something I’m prepared for and is safe. To say however that you can’t refuse jobs concerns me in the event I’m offered a role that has nothing to do with what I know that is incredibly difficult and dangerous to get to and from/to do. 

I’m concerned about the event where I’m offered jobs that are difficult to get to or completely outside of what I want to do or is even safe to do. Also what happens if the job is incredibly far away? One of my parents is immunocompromised I’m just supposed to take whatever they give regardless? Isn’t one of the key reasons they closed in person schools in the first place the fact that the virus can spread to others in someone’s household? Wouldn’t the job put me over the $1000 threshold, and if it doesn’t wouldn’t I be working so few hours the potential dangers of going into the workforce would make it pointless anyways? If it’s this easy to pair jobs with employees why did Canada lose 2 million jobs in April and what about the millions who’re currently receiving CERB? AFAIK they don’t have to even put a check mark for job searching on their forms, let alone this whole confirmation sheet students are expected to document.

If it’s purely just job searching what’s an adequate amount of searches they’d find appropriate? 100 applications in a month? 1 a month? Do applications need to all be done spread throughout weeks or can there be many done in a couple of days and that’s fine? The check box marking on applying for CESB would’ve been more than fine, the amount of variables that are really unknown and seem like they always will be just makes this whole thing even more stressful😔",1589441185.0,2020,2020-05-14,10,fqkzlho,t3_gbjezc,t3_gbjezc

If you do not want it you can simply disregard the notification and go on with your day. I read the whole bill and there is nothing saying you are obligated to take whatever they give you; just that you will be notified if something is available.

&#x200B;

**CERB -**

Royal Assent: March 25

Application Up: April 6

12 days

**CEWS -**

Royal Assent: April 11

Application Up: April 27

16 days

**CESB -**

Royal Assent: May 1

5 days as of May 6

So, if the past is any guide:

Application Up: May 13 to May 18

&#x200B;

They announced the application dates for CERB and CEWS a few days before the applications went up. For CERB, they announced the April 6 date on April 1. For CEWS, they announced the April 27 date on April 21. So, five or six days in advance. Hopefully, we get a CESB application date announcement by Friday of this week (that is, May 8).

With any luck, they're getting good at building these systems by now and the application will be up sooner rather than later. In any case, CERB and CEWS applicants didn't have to wait long to get the money. With direct deposit, they typically received the money 2-3 days after submitting their application. If you don't want to wait longer than that, make sure you have direct deposit set up on your CRA account!",1588804538.0,2020,2020-05-06,3,fpplkwf,t3_gbhdal,t3_gbhdal

NoNumber1,"I’m going to post some key points I’ve heard throughout the discussion. If /u/warriorlynx chooses to post those in their updates above, that’s great too.

1. The CESB will be accessed by the My CRA portal, and is intended to cover University, College, CEGEP, and High School students who have graduated and are enrolled in a post secondary program. Additionally, those who have graduated from their post secondary program no earlier than December 2019 would also be eligible.

2. Green Party member Elizabeth May points out that international students are potentially eligible for the CERB, but presently NOT for the CESB, despite bringing over 20 billion dollars to the Canadian economy annually. The Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion dodges the question and says that Intl Students have been allowed to work more hours.

3. Deputy PM Chrystia Freeland notes that student employment from February to March dropped 28%.

4. Volunteers who work with the government over the summer will be entitled to up to $5000 ""to support recipients education costs next year"".

They also intend to help by: ""doubling student grants for all $6000 for full time students, $3000 for part time students"", and ""$210 to $350 weekly student loan budget increase""

5. Bloc member makes a point that one specific student opted not to return to full time work because they would not be eligible for benefits any longer if she earned too much. The Member is really working this anecdote to prove a point.

6. A quick note on the bill as presented in the first reading... Students WILL be able to collect the CESB if they have previously collected CERB. They just won't be able to claim both during the same ""period"".

7. The Green Party wants the sunset clause removed from the bill. This is a point that the Conservatives advocated for which stipulates that the benefit can not be extended without reconvening parliament, should the need exist.

8. International students who ARE permanent residents (specific, I know), will be eligible for this benefit",1588186565.0,2020,2020-04-29,1,foz8qya,t3_gadqmc,t3_gadqmc

Every time I heard the Liberals, NDP, Greens and Bloc speak it felt like they were truly trying to help students and improve the program in every shape possible. Then every time I heard the conservatives speak I felt like they look down on students, viewing them as irresponsible lazy kids. They talked about sending us to farms, restaurants, and taking away the “hand out” well hello, literally nobody is hiring. They make it seem so easy “oh the grocery store is hiring.” When I know tons of people applying who don’t even get an interview.

That said, just what on earth are the PCs smoking? Fisheries and farms? I cannot believe they are seriously advocating that university students and kids, who now have a pandemic as well as their already-bleak future outlooks to deal with, should be funneled into back-breaking and miserable jobs instead of getting some basic support. What about students who live in urban centres like Toronto or Vancouver? What if students just don't want to work in potentially compromised environments? 

$1250 per month is not a lot of money, kids. That is peanuts - possibly even dorito-chip residue.

Student: ""Well, I depleted my savings and my credit card is maxed out. Do you accept 1000$ credits towards tuition?""

I mean, come on.

- Increasing volunteer-based home deliveries of groceries and medications
- Providing transportation services, like accompanying or driving seniors or persons with disabilities to appointments
- Scaling up help lines that provide information and support
- Helping vulnerable Canadians access government benefits
- Providing training, supplies, and other required supports to volunteers so they can continue to make their invaluable contributions to the COVID-19 response
