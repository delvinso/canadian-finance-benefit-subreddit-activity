Question about CESB eligibility,"Hello, I applied and got the cesb benefits of all periods.

Recently, I was double checking the requirments on cra website. and I found out one thing that was a bit confused, so I wanna ask here for advice.

First of all, let me show my eligibilities according to the requirement list on cra website

1. I didn’t apply for CERB or EI during the same periods

2. Im permanent resident

(?)3. You were studying in Canada or abroad, when you applied.

4. I completed or ended post-sencondary studies in december or later

5. I was unable to find work due to corona.

so I took 6months program in BCIT that started on August 2019 and ended on Feb 2020.

I’m confused about the 3rd requirement 

‘You were studying in Canada or abroad, when you applied’

Since I finished the the program that leads to certificate from Aug2019 to Feb2020, when I applied for cesb(in April/May), I was already finished the program, but not schooling anymore. 

Was I still considered as ‘I was studying in Canada’ since I was looking for job thru May after I finished the program in Feb? 

Or should I be actually and physically schooling until May?

I got my t4a and t2202slips for 2019, but a bit confused on that term:

‘You were studying in Canada or abroad, when you applied’

Update: I called again on the 31st of December 2020 and the rep said she'll send it to her supervisor because it's been awhile. On the 12th, I got a call from the CRA person looking at my case.

Retroactively Switching CERB to CESB,"Hey guys!

I just realized I should have been applying for CESB - not CERB this summer. I received several payments of CERB throughout the summer. **Does anyone have any advice or know if it's possible to still change it?** Additionally, *I am a student with a disability so I believe I'd qualify for the extra $750 making the CESB payment equivalent to the CERB payments I received.*

Little bit about my story -it's long / complicated.

I had a summer FSWEP government job lined up for the summer but it fell through mid-April because of COVID-19. I decided to keep working part-time at my second job which was at a grocery store. I was a member of a union at this store - but the location I was working at was not taking COVID-19 seriously despite going into lockdown. The store is tiny, but they were hardly limiting customers / masks were not mandatory (until by-law enforced it right after I was no longer employed there). A number of employees expressed concern about the health / safety of customers / staff to management and ownership. Letters were written by staff, meetings were had, but from our perspective not enough was being done. A few things happened that made it seem like the ownership was watching / coming after employees who were speaking out. On top of all of this during this same time period I witnessed and heard about some extremely concerning incidents of racism in the store - some of which were coming from the ownership/management and directed at customers. Long story short I was dismissed mid-June for ""unrelated"" reasons (but I believe they were looking for a reason to dismiss me because I was speaking out about the racism and what I thought were inadequate COVID-19 policies). Since my dismissal I have spent the last 5 months grieving it through my union. However, at the time I thought I qualified for CERB for 2 reasons. One because, like I said, I firmly believe they were looking for a reason to let me go because of COVID-19 and secondly, since my full-time summer job fell through because of COVID-19. I also had a number of interviews for summer student government jobs not amount to anything following my dismissal. So I have remained unemployed and am now back in full-time university.

Fast forward to now (end of November) - I am close to reaching a settlement with my old employers through my union. Part of it will be changing my ROE to say that I quit. In normal situations this is a great for a number of reasons. However, after hours of reading up I realized I maybe shouldn't have applied for CERB, but rather CESB. The CRA did not require me to provide my ROE upon applying and I didn't fully understand (my fault I know, but the government was so vague so I don't know) that because my ROE used the dismissal code I probably didn't qualify despite knowing my employer was letting me go unjustly and potentially because of my concerns on their handling of COVID-19 which resulted in my feeling like going to  work was unsafe. Anyway, through my research I realized I probably should have been applying for CESB not CERB.

Does anyone have any advice on how to go about this process / if it's still possible to do this? I know I will a little bit of money back to the government; but I do not have all the funds to do so right now. *I read somewhere I should make a repayment before December - is this true?* However, since I think I qualified for the $1250 CESB + $750 disability it might not be that much. I realize didn't know that I had to retroactively apply before September 30th because I didn't think this was the aid I qualified for. I know that this was partly my fault but my situation was confusing.

WHY IS CRA TAKING SO LONG TO GIVE ME THE CESB?,"So I first initially called in July to apply for the CESB, and I was told I will be receiving a call back for the longest time. Every single time I call back, I am told to wait for another 2-4 weeks, and that they couldn't do anything on their end because my case was being reviewed/processed. In the end, I never received a callback and it was passed the deadline. I called again around the beginning of October and was told to fax in some files for identification, proof that I'm in school etc. So I did, twice so far one around mid-October and one last week. Today I called and my files haven't been uploaded to my case and that they don't know how long that would take. 

I am honestly so tired of this ongoing cycle that never seems to end. How long did it take you guys to get a callback and receive your benefit from the time of faxing? I am sick of waiting and wasting time on call for hours every week when I should be focusing on school.

CESB advice needed - I don’t know what else to do,"I am a 1st year university student - right out of highschool. I have been trying to apply for CESB long before the deadline and because I did not have income to report to CRA, I never had a CRA account. I was told to file a return so I filed a zero income tax return just to get my name on the system but it has been a couple months and it was not ever assessed. 

Everytime I have called they tell me to keep waiting. Ive tried every day  to register for My Account and I only get an error message when entering my SIN. I called on Oct 2nd which was after the Sept 30th deadline and was still told to wait until I receive something in the mail. Never received anything. I called again last week and waited a total of 3 hours to speak to somebody (a representative disconnected first attempt once they picked up) and was told its likely going to be too late to apply. I was completely shocked as I was told to keep waiting so I thought that I may have recourse because of my tax return issue. She was kind enough to put in an investivation said that there is no set time that somebody will get back to me. I have no idea what else to do as I was always eligible for the benefit but could never apply because of CRA not assessing my return. Is there somebody I can contact? I feel so defeated 😔

Sent back Cheque in mail early September...never heard back and no money taken from my account.,"Hey there,

I graduated high school in June, but took CESB in the month of May. Later on after cashing the cheque via a photo, I found out I was not entitled to this money. 

I sent back the cheque to the correct address with my SIN and reason of return in early September...have not heard a thing since. I have no idea if they even got it, and I’m hesitant to repay the money back online unless I know that they couldn’t take the money since the cheque was already cashed.

So I ask, was it impossible for them to take the money out of my account even though I mailed them the original cheque which had already been deposited? If so, I’ll repay online. If not, I’ll wait. I’ve tried calling them for the past week but the CESB hotline doesn’t even have a selection for CESB, so I tried the CERB one and couldn’t get through for the past week.

Has anyone been charged by a third party company for assistance with CESB/CERB/EI applications?,"Hey everyone,

I'm a student reporter with The Signal and I'm looking for people who have gotten help from a third party with the CERB/CESB/EI application processes.

One company, Canada Tax Reviews INC., charges a percentage that adds up to $160 for each CERB period they help you apply for. 

If you've used their services, or any other services that resulted you paying money for emergency response benefits you could have applied for for free, I'd love to hear about it.

Also, if you know of anyone who use similar services instead of applying directly through CRA or Sevice Canada, for whatever reason, I'd love to hear from them too.

"Applied for March and April CERB, CRA says I can only get 2 periods of CESB now?","I called the hotline to apply for CESB, but it only accepted the last period and told me to call 1-800-717-7735 for the others.

The thing is, before the CESB was announced, I applied for the first 2 periods of CERB (I'd be eligible for either one). I didn't apply for the ones that overlap with CESB (May-Aug). I know at first you could only get 16 weeks of either, but they extended it to 24.

So the first agent I talked to said there was no problem with me applying for the 4 CESB periods after the Mar+Apr CERB. Unfortunately the call dropped.

When I called back, the next agent told me since I'd applied for CESB, I could only get 4 periods of benefits combined total. They only let me apply for 1 more CESB. (So the 2 CERB plus 2 CESB)

Is this correct? Everything I've heard says you can collect 6 periods of benefits, as long as you don't apply for both in the same period. (I didn't!)",2,1601320227.0,2020,2020-09-28,CESB Question,brainshockalpha,0,j1ikio

If you haven’t gotten a call back from the officer that was supposed to call you back to confirm your identity, call CRA again and explain your situation, some agents will send you to a line where they’ll tell you to fax documents to a certain number. Please do that ASAP it’s usually much faster than filing your taxes so you’ll increase your chances of getting cesb. If you did fax your documents but didn’t hear back, please call them and follow up. I followed up because I didn’t hear back, and they told me then that they received my documents and the agent applied for the benefit for me.

Basically it's the support number for when the 2 automated lines say your application cannot be processed.

One caveat is that they did end up having to ask my parents for info verification purposes (e.g. address and postal info), but otherwise just make sure you have direct deposit info ready unless you want payment by cheque.

Recently Sent Verification Information In,"Hi everyone,

I recently tried applying for CESB. Unfortunately my application didn't go through, and I was asked to send in documents that validated my identity/eligibility either through fax or online on my account (I have filed my 2019 taxes and have a CRA myaccount already). I send in all required documentation about a week ago and I'm still waiting to hear back from the CRA. I am still banned from applying for the CESB online, which leads me to believe they haven't processed my documents yet. Does anyone here have any experience with sending in their documents through the online feature on myaccount?

Working After CESB,"Question:

I know the final CESB period ended on August 29th and I received payments for all 4 periods. However, I recently got a job that began on September 2nd that I'm gonna be working part-time while studying full time in university. Through my job, I may be making slightly more than $1000 a month.

Post-CESB,"So I think I know the answer to this, but I will ask anyway.

I went back to school for a second run through college, graduating among the first batch of graduates in the country for the program in question (literally the first college offering the type of program).  Unfortunately, the final term ended in April of this year - and all of the opportunities that were sitting there waiting for us upon graduation instantly dissolved when the COVID pandemic started to cancel everything.  As a result, all of the effort I have put into graduating with honours and trying to get the best second chance I could for myself literally vanished with all of those lost opportunities, leaving me sitting in a house muttering about misfortune and wondering where my next money is coming from.

I DID qualify for the CESB (since this is a CESB board, I should make that connection), but I have discovered that there seems to be no future benefit for graduating students who did not put in 120 hours of employable work prior to the change in rules - this not considering the fact that students put in two years of work (or more!) in our various programs and concentrate on that instead of trying to maintain employment at the same time, meaning that some of us don't have the hours and still can't find jobs now.  As a result, graduating students who are not going back and thus don't have another round of OSAP to lean on are literally being left high and dry - and we still have to pay our student loans (or at least incur interest on them) even though our lives are literally placed on pause during this pandemic.

Does anyone know of any options I might have?  I'm also dealing with a delay in being allowed to apply for my last CESB payment due to that Validation and ""Protection"" thing I saw a post on already (not really helpful when we can't make bill payments), but even while I will probably survive that for a month, I won't last forever even after getting that payment.  Further, getting jobs right now would prove difficult because I literally cannot wear a mask for more than a few minutes before feeling like I'm going to suffocate myself.  I contacted my MP but the response was something along the lines of ""Go work at Tim Horton's to make up the hours"" - not even considering that if you even get employment, you literally have to keep the job and not be fired from it, or the 120 hours gained means absolutely nothing.  Do I have to literally put myself in harm's way working in a high risk environment, or is there something I can benefit from here when the CESB payments end?  Or is Ontario Works my only option?",5,1599712915.0,2020,2020-09-10,CESB Question,CycloneGU,0,ipwnxp

So, I called 1-800-959-8281.

I also have access to a T4 slip with my old address on it, but was told that even that would not provide enough authentication.

"Just finished school, now what?","Hey all!

&#x200B;

My wife just finished a 1-year program on August 21st and is officially ""completed"" her schooling. We haven't applied for the CESB because she was a full-time student, but now as expected there is not a lot of work available in her industry. CESB is ending of course and I've been told by CRA that unless she can demonstrate job applications (via Job Bank) for the full month she cannot apply for the August eligibility period. 

I wondered about her applying for CERB - because she did make over $5000 in 2019 before starting school in August 2019 - so I thought she may technically be eligible for that.

Any advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated! It seems that her date of finishing school has put us in an extremely weird situation and hoping to do the right thing.

Disability and CESB," 

I have read the backgrounder for CESB, which, it seems, is continuously updated.

From what I read, if you have a disability, you must provide proof from a regulated medical professional.

Next, you must be looking for work. If you are unable to work it must be due to COVID-19.

But, if you cannot work due to your disability because of COVID-19 and have disabilities /underlying health conditions those disabilities/underlying heath conditions must only be the listed underlying health conditions (heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, compromised immune system)

So if your disability/condition if not listed as those listed health conditions, but COVID-19 has or would cause a worsening of those conditions, or would cause you to face increased risk, you are not eligible for CESB, is this correct ?",4,1597879291.0,2020,2020-08-19,CESB Question,Infinite_Holiday3209,15,icywvl

Therefore, I am now magically short of $2500 ($4000 if the government determines that ASD is a permanent disability). Just what I needed when I still need to pay off tuition and lead an independent life of my own.

Hi guys, I have made a calculation. 

I have received 2000$ from CESB in August.

 I have a slight dissablity so CESB gave me 2000$ for August.

Assuming 5\* 4 \* 15$/hour = 600 dollar per week = 1200$ in 2 weeks.  So I can earn 1200$ from a minimum wage job in 2 weeks. Since it is over the 1000$ dollar limit, I have to repay back the full 2000$ dollar amount if I earn more than 1000$ during the remaining 2 weeks in August ?",5,1597254618.0,2020,2020-08-12,CESB Question,masterinex,4,i8ige8

She'll hit me with her heavy hands on my shoulder, stomach and sometimes my back. It hurts tbh. I told her not to call on my weight cause its not nice .

[Help] CRA agent said I will receive a call within ~30 days from another group in order to apply for CESB,"I have called several times and first called last month in order to activate my SIN at 1-800-959-8281. The agent asked to speak to a parent to verify my identity but they weren't present at the time so I was given the option to call back another day which I did. 

After that call, they're telling me now that they will call me within the next 30 business days (estimate) in order to activate and allow me to apply to cesb which is ridiculous because everyone I know has managed to call and apply. Plus, the benefit will end in sept 30th so based on this, I may not even get it even though I'm qualified. Also, I have no clue what happens if I miss the call. There's been many fraudulent calls from scammers pretending to be the CRA stating that my SIN has been suspended (even tho its not activated which is funny) so I tend to avoid picking up unknown numbers so this method is flawed.

I tried filing my taxes online (simpletax) and it went through successfully but they say they have nothing on their end since I dont have an account and I'm a first time filer. Signed up for email in the tax form and I still havent received anything. (Its been ~3 weeks).

If i try registering through CRA myaccount, I get the error-err.210 when I enter my sin so that's not an option either. Nor can I use the automated line at 1-800-959-2041 since its not activated for me. 

I have no idea what to do... they're saying its a new policy because they're getting lots of calls and they don't know when exactly I will get the call nor who will call me.

Has this happened to anybody?

So, I just recently graduated and have been struggling to find employment. I wasn't aware that there was a a program equivalent to CERB for students up until now.

I'm eligible for the $2000 with the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) because I have a disability. However, I was only able to apply for the July and August months.

Is there anyway I can get backpay for the May and June? I have been financially struggling and my parents were supporting me via a loan. I have no way of paying that back unless I can get the backpay.

Accidentally Applied for the CERB thinking I was eligible long ago and I can't apply for the CESB apparently,"Whew, so its a bit of a doozy but uh, I applied for the CERB (in May) thinking I was eligible, and I got the money and what-have-you.

I paid the government back the amount they gave to me, but problem is, on my account it says that I already applied for the EI or CERB, and that I must continue to make reports to continue receiving benefits (which I'm not eligible for...), and that I CANNOT apply for the CESB at all. (Also its given me Ref. code: COV-005)...

How am I able to terminate the EI/CERB claim so I can apply for the CESB? I've been trying to look for concrete answers, but I've reached nothing but dead ends.

Question about attending school,"So I’m going into my first year of university, I graduated highschool in 2018, and have been doing academic upgrading since then. I’m taking some lighter courses in the fall term but I’m taking some science courses in the winter term, my plan was that if I struggled with online courses in the fall I would defer my education until 2021, since I’m fairly certain I would struggle to learn biology and geography online, and I want to get the highest marks I can. 

The CESB says; 

“New post-secondary students with classes starting on or before February 1, 2021, who were not enrolled in high school in 2020 should have documents showing that:

their application for admission into a post-secondary program was accepted before the four-week CESB period for which they applied. 

If requested in future, they must provide evidence of attending a post-secondary program before February 1, 2021.” 
 

Does that mean that I could attend for the fall semester and if I was struggling I could defer or drop out till the 2021 fall term? I’m trying to figure out if I’m locking myself into a full year of schooling by accepting the CESB",2,1596657801.0,2020,2020-08-05,CESB Question,slopcrusher,1,i4comn

Can you get CESB with a job? (+CRA question),"Hello,

In the past few days I recently managed to get a part-time at a place I was referenced to by a family member and I was wondering if I could still apply for CESB? I only go in 1-3 days a week depending on how much work is left to do and I'm only working through August. 

Also, since my relative introduced the job to me (summer job searching came into conversation somehow and when I asked them they introduced a few and I've been hired at one of them) in person I don't really have any physical proof that I've been job searching. How often will they ask for proof of your searches? I saw some older posts saying it's mainly only if your account/background is suspicious but has anyone who doesn't have special circumstances get asked for proof? If I am asked for proof, what should I do (for example, do I give the name of my relative and their contact information so they can confirm with CRA or whoever that the conversation took place?)? 

In addition, I had some questions about setting up a CRA account as well. I am a recent high school graduate and I have not done taxes before (which you apparently have to do beforehand in order to set up a CRA account online). This may be a dumb question, but what taxes does a high schooler have to do? Would it just be for income earned previously? If I've never earned any money before, what would I do then?

The final countdown for CESB,"August starts tomorrow, which means we have 1 month left of CESB. I can tell you (and I\`m sure hundreds of thousands are with me on this) that this summer was shit and the amount of unemployed students (although I get it) is insane.

So since we\`re on the final leg, let\`s discuss the jobs we applied to, success rates and what I wish could have been done better.

Total jobs applied to: 26

Heard back from: I\`d say \~10. All of them saying they reviewed my application and it was not selected, try again.

Types of Jobs applied to: QA tester/Game tester (I have 0 experience with this, but I know they like to hire new people) customer service, bookkeeper (I have experience helping friends/family here), data entry and shot in the dark applications such as assistant manager positions or ESL teaching (when you get desperate, you gotta do what you gotta do).

Interviews: 1 (next week) and of course, when we're 4 weeks away to returning to school.

**EDIT: Did not get the job since I'm returning to school. They were only looking for full time, and since I'm a student + my involvement in school politics... no go. Although they did keep my resume so there is hope.**

Success Rate: 0.04 (4%)  (1 interview out of 25 applied jobs).

**EDITED SUCCESS RATE: 0 (1 interview out of 26 applied jobs, but did not get the job, so 0 success)**

Wish what could have been done better: More clear background info on seeking for work, a better student job bank that gives you realistic options (and not welders/senior care only... in my case) and a site that actually tracked your activity. Also since they (the government) fucked up CSSG, I believe they should make it up by giving us a direct grant.

Regardless, I've looked for work, will continue to do so, and with me meeting the requirements and actually applying to jobs, I'm in the clear. Sure, some were a stretch, but sometimes you gotta YOLO it.",54,1596233781.0,2020,2020-07-31,CESB Discussion,yeezybreezy666,79,i1gt01

Question About the $1000 Limit,"Hi guys!

I just have a question about earning money in between application periods. I got hired at a berry farm at the beginning of July. I worked on July 1st, 3rd, and 4th, before working the rest of my shifts for the month. I got the paycheque for the payment period of July 1st-July 18th (it was a 2 1/2 week pay period because of our opening date on the 1st in the middle of the week) and it was just over $800. I only got to work 2 more shifts in July before the farm had an early shut down and I lost my job. With the \[paycheque I get from those 2 shifts, I will have earned just over $1000 in the month of July. But since 3 of those shifts were worked in the previous application period (June 7-July 4th) am I still eligible for the July5th-August 1st period? I technically earned over $300 of the $1000 I got this month in the previous application period, but since those shifts were included on the $800 paycheque that got put into my account after July 4th, am I disqualified? I'm sorry if this is kind of confusing or worded weirdly. Thanks in advance!

I also have the pay stub that says the period I earned money in, but it doesn't list the specific dates I worked on, just that I made $800 between July 1st and July 18th.

Applying for jobs is getting annoying,"This is more of a rant than anything but I'm starting to get annoyed by the way that the job search requirement and the 1k limit is set up. I'm a student, I'm going back to university full time in the fall so I can't work a normal 9-5 full time job then. That means that no employer wants to hire me full time now just so I can drop my hours in a month and if the Canada summer jobs thing is any indication, no one wants to hire someone to only work a summer job for on the month of August either. I also can't really apply for part time jobs because if I get one it will undoubtedly take me like 100 dollars over the 1k limit and I won't have enough money to pay my rent, my bills and also eat.

The way this is set up is so stupid. If the 1k limit was a progressive limit and any money over that amount reduced the amount of money you got from the benefit then I probably could at least find a job that gave me ~20 hours a week without worrying about it. The way it is now though I'm applying for jobs and having to give caveats that even though this is a full time position I can only work full time for a month.",15,1595958883.0,2020,2020-07-28,CESB Discussion,GuyofMshire,83,hzje98

I hope you’re all doing well and you, as well as, your family are staying safe. I was just curious if anyone has a concrete definition of what “looking for work” entails? Currently, I’ve been looking for jobs which I have experience in (mostly retail and labor stuff) and applying to those such positions, while checking indeed, the government job bank, LinkedIn jobs, and the Facebook job page daily. However, I’m a full time student so at this point, no one is really looking to hire for the little time before the semester begins. Just want to have all bases covered and ensure that I’m doing what’s required of me in case the CRA asks for proof of looking for a job. 

Furthermore, if anyone here has previously applied for the CERB, returned the CERB payment via the online CRA website, and then called the CRA to enquire about getting the CESB money for previous periods, could you please shoot me a message? I’m have a couple questions I’d like to discuss.

August Job Search Expectations for Students Returning to School,"So as we've all read countless times already, one of the possible criteria for getting CESB money is to be looking for employment but unable to find it. If this applies to you, the CRA expects you to be searching for jobs about three days a week and to document your job search efforts.

Given the current state of the job market, many of us are still unemployed and searching for jobs. However, the vast majority of us are also returning to school in September and were only looking for a summer job, not a permanent full-time job. Realistically, almost nobody is going to find a summer job from this point onwards, especially given the current state of the job market.

I am curious to see what are peoples' plans for the August eligibility period if this applies to you as well. I would assume that we are eligible to take CESB for this period since the whole purpose of the program was to serve as income replacement for a job that you could have gotten this summer were the job market in a better state than it currently is. I'm also highly aware though that most of us will have pretty much nothing to show for it, since it is highly unlikely anyone would want to employ you for a period of less than a month.

Question about Part-time job CESB,"Hi. To give a bit of background, I was unemployed from end of January to 4th week of June. I am also a post-secondary mature student who took a gap year and will be attending a new program in September Fall 2020.(accepted my offer in February).
I applied to CESB from all periods May,June and July since I have no job in the beginning. However, I've been constantly applying to jobs via indeed and I got an interview back in June and started to work beginning june 27 PART-TIME only weekends since i have a 2year old child to look after.. 
Since I can only work part-time,  that leads me to earn less than the threshold amount of $1000 and wil be applying up to the last period which will be August.


The criteria for eligibility ask you to be:

-a post-secondary student

-you are unable to work due to COVID-19

-you are looking for, but cannot find work due to COVID19

-you are currently working during the COVID-19 pandemic, but your income from employment and self-employment has been $1,000


My question is, does having part-time job that earns less than $1000 /eligibility period good enough to qualify for the CESB? OR does it have to be full time job?

What should I do?,"In a little of a dilemma and looking for opinions:

I applied to several summer jobs and got hired as an office assistant. The position pays minimum wage, $14.60/hr (I remembered it was higher at first, but I guess I mistook it for another), and has little to do with what I want to do in the future. It’s not a bad/stressful job, though it’s not the most fulfilling and I feel as though I could be doing a lot of other things I enjoy (such as volunteering or learning a new skill). Furthermore, CESB makes staying at home seem more worth.

At the end of my work period, I would have made $3942 (~$3830 after considering transit fares).
Two terms of CESB (I’m a highschool grad) would be $2500.

In terms of money alone, working is obviously better. Though I am missing out on a lot of my summer and using time I could have put towards something else. What would you do in this situation?

"Term ""attestation"" in the official Bill C-15 vs Backgrounder",[removed],0,1594943490.0,2020,2020-07-16,CESB Discussion,,1,hsl88c
"Term ""attestation"" in the official Bill C-15 vs Backgrounder","Hey guys, sorry to be a bother, I've brought up a couple discussions in the past days on here as I'm a bit late to joining this Reddit group. I wanted to open up a discussion here on your thoughts!

 I personally have my job searches and stuff in order so far to prove that I have been at least looking for work in each CESB period and lately I've also been doing more research into the actual Bill and the requirements that we as students have been required to attest to.. I'm seeing that in the official Bill C-15 (1st review, 3rd review and Royal Assent) about the CESB the description they use to quantify an attestation is as such: 


""Attestation

(2) A student who applies on the basis that they are seeking work, whether as an employee or in self-employment, but are unable to find it must, *in their application*, attest to the fact that they are seeking work.""

[Bill C-15](https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-1/bill/C-15/royal-assent)

Whereas the ""Backgrounder"" (which, must I add, not nearly as many students outside those who are here on Reddit have noticed or are going read) states a more thorough criteria:

""Documentation required

Applicants will be required to attest to meeting the eligibility criteria and that the information they are providing is accurate. They do not have to provide documents as part of their CESB application. However, students may be asked to produce documents in the future to support their attestation. They should keep records to support their attestation at a future date.""

""A student who is able to work must be looking for a job on a regular basis (i.e. at least three days per week) and must document all of their job search efforts for the duration of the CESB period. Evidence of a student’s active job search includes:

regular documentation of job-search results, including search dates, application dates, tools used, employer names and the type for work that they looking for. Job Bank provides useful tools to document job search efforts;

emails to prospective employers and responses to employers who contacted them;

emails or documentation of enrollment and communication efforts with an employment agency;

screen shots or links to job postings or copies of job ads, flyers, postings, etc. within a student’s local area;

confirmation of enrollment or participation in job search workshops or job fairs;

emails or screen shots of job applications submitted for suitable jobs; and

emails to demonstrate that they attended job interviews in person, over the phone or virtually.""

[CESB Backgrounder ](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/news/2020/05/backgrounder-the-canada-emergency-student-benefit.html)


My questions, in the end, are why do things seem so arbitrary between the actual Bill C-15 and the Backgrounder as per specifications made by the CRA? Why are the Backgrounder requirements not just made clear during the application process for the benefits or BETTER yet, in the actually Bill C-15 passed through the HOC and Senate? This would have saved a lot of students a world of stress and worrying and will help to not surprise some students come 2021. Would it have been that hard to add these Backgrounder specifications into the actual writing of Bill C-15 if they really wanted to enforce it? Are they able to legally pursue students for the money if the Bill C-15 is very vague on its specifications for the attestation it's looking for? I'm sure the CRA can do what they want but on what grounds? The grounds of their own terms or will Student Unions stand against that by bringing up Bill C-15 in to question to contrast the requirements that were originally agreed upon?",10,1594943490.0,2020,2020-07-16,CESB Discussion,Hiddenlotvs,26,hsl888

Weird CESB eligibility question,"Apologies I'm advance, this could be a weird one.

So my wife had to take time off due to a re-agrivated shoulder injury. She was prescribed 6 weeks of physio. That was back in mid-March when everything shut down.

For CESB (she's going to school in the fall) it seems the rule is ""Unable to work due to COVID19"".

She was willing/wanting to go to physio in March and return to work as soon as it was done, but out here (Alberta), all of our physiotherapist offices were closed until mid-May when they slowly opened up. She was on a waiting list and is only starting therapy today. So all in all, with the closure and wait list, she'll have been off for an extra 11 weeks, if my math is right, directly due to covid.

Would she qualify for either benefit due to this?

I will be calling the CRA to ask later on but I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask here.",1,1594750179.0,2020,2020-07-14,CESB Question,OMGMajorRager,1,hr6m1i

How do I know I've been doing enough job searching thus far?,"So, basically, my question is open for discussion and comes from the fact that I've been feeling conflicted lately. I don't know whether I've doing enough or if I'm just being anxious or fearful that I haven't applied to enough job positions.  I have applied to over 10 positions that interest me over the past 3 CESB terms as well as updated my CV, worked on my resume, done the career quizzes, created accounts on Indeed and Job Bank, showed some of my activity , presented a couple phone dialogue proofs, invitations to job seminars and information sessions.  I'll admit, I did start off a bit slow in the earlier CESB benefit periods but I have picked up the pace quite a lot and am applying searching and planning to apply to many more places. How am I supposed to know whether I've done enough or not so that I don't have to worry that CRA will ask for my Benefits back because they think I wasn't trying hard enough to find a job? Is that not arbitrary in a way? Or is the point of all this just go show that I have been searching for work. I really need some enlightenment and guidance about this. I definitely have been looking for work so it would suck if I would then have to fork over money back in the end of all of this job searching because I haven't done so frequently enough.",14,1594696094.0,2020,2020-07-13,CESB Discussion,Hiddenlotvs,18,hqtqjk

Before I start: How is everyone doing? I know it's been a wacky and stressful summer. But I think a mental health check is much needed.

For me:

1. Look 3-4 times a week
2. The Canada Job Bank is honestly the biggest joke I've seen so far. so is the CSSG, did fuck all.
3.

I'm looking for options but most are full time (I was gonna do part-time in general this summer) and you need French.
4. If I don't find work by end of July, I'm no longer going to apply for CESB. I will find it weird to apply to a job (and let's say I get one) and quit 2 weeks after because school will start soon and I have to prepare.

However, I have been claiming CESB for all periods. Does it mean that I have to pay back all the money I got? 

There was a post that said I have to be enrolled/applied to PSE before the CESB period that I applied. Which means I can get the August period since I got accepted to university before august.

 I have a quick question about what counts as being ""Unable to work"".

CERB or CESB?,"I was a student for two years at a university and took a year off at the end of April 2019. I am returning to my studies in September to finish my degree.

I have been receiving CERB for the past 4 months as I've lost my self-employed income due to COVID. However I am somewhat confused as to whether I now qualify as a student or a worker in the government's eyes.

As of this month, I am officially re-enrolled in school, but prior to this month I wasn't sure if I would return, or what I would do next. This entire academic year I have been officially considered as a year off student, not a full blown dropout.

So my question is, do I apply for CESB, or CERB for this month? Or have I been ineligible for CERB to begin with.

The government site says that students starting their studies in september are elgibile for CESB, but I was not officially enrolled until now. The employee I called at the CRA said that I should apply for CERB given that they only look at each individual 4 week period despite me being officially enrolled starting now.

Quick question on eligibility. I have been working for Appen throughout the year, and for people who don't know, they are basically a contractor-based company that people work on available projects for.

\- Prior to COVID-19, I very rarely logged on and worked, as I am a full-time student and with commuting (2h+ each way) I rarely had the time to sit down and clock in some work.

\- With COVID-19, the available projects that were there prior to the pandemic are mostly all gone, with new projects I rarely qualify for.

I'm still making some income, but it's really, really meagre (think sub-$100 per month).

Am I engaging in Fraud?,"I recently got a part time job, with a small progressive organization. The original contract was set to be 16 hours a week at 20$/h. This comes out to 1280$ a month. I'm currently on CESB receiving my monthly 1250$. Since 1280 is > then 1000 i loose my CESB benefits, which means that if I accepted the contract as is, I would essentially be making 46 cents an hour for my 64hours of labour a month compared to simply not working and cashing in the CESB.   


What i've done is purposefully ask the Executives of the organization to delay my payroll by a week so that for July i would only get paid for 3 weeks (16\*20\*3= 960$). This means that i would still qualify to get the CESB as i would make less than a 1000$ for the July period. This would bring my total earnings for july to 2210$ compared to 1280$ if the organization would have paid me for my first week. 

I've also asked if i could take an unpaid vacation week in August, and they said that it would be fine. So I should still be able to get CESB in August also. 

My question is: is any of this Fraudulent? There is written email records of me asking the executives to essentially not pay me for a week of work so that i can cash in the CESB, and they agreed to it knowing the reasoning for it. I couldn't find any other threads that dealt with this. Any help would be appreciated.",15,1594311235.0,2020,2020-07-09,CESB Question,Agitopian,3,ho5vy2

Proving Eligibility Period Question,"It states that to qualify, your income cannot exceed $1000 during the eligibility period you apply for, so this cycle is from July 5 to August 1. But, I’ve been working since June 24 and from June 24 - July 4 (before July 5 the start date of the period) I’ve technically earned over $350. However, I haven’t been paid yet because I get paid bi-weekly which means when I do get paid, it’ll be during the eligibility period since it’s already July 8 and the period started July 5. But I'm required to work min 15 hrs/week, its a min wage job. So because I haven’t been paid yet for the work I did before July 5, does that mean that’ll put me at over $1000 by August 1 (the last day of eligibility) since $350 +$840 is over $1000 ($840 is how much I'll earn from July 5 - August 1)? The pay is set up as direct deposit and I wouldn't know how to prove I earned that $350 before the eligibility started.",2,1594258504.0,2020,2020-07-08,CESB Question,cc10134t,4,hnu2zt

"I managed to land a job, but after a few shifts I'm questioning how safe it is. Would my reasoning to quit be sound?","Through some luck I landed a job at a restaurant on my first and only interview out of the forty-something applications I sent out. Initially from the protocols that were sent my way, it seemed like things were handled well, but I'm really second-guessing myself now.

No one has bothered to socially distance. Not a single person wears a mask. Customers have touched me while walking by or to get my attention. It's in a high-tourist area, and oh boy are there tourists galore (many coming from outside of my province). Honestly, I'm kicking myself for not foreseeing this, and I knew there would be some risk, but it did end up being a bit more out of control than I anticipated.

Furthermore, I am a bit more high-risk with exercise-induced asthma. I am also living with my parents, and my mother has the same condition. My dad also owns a business and if I bring the virus home to him he could be screwed financially.

I would hope this is enough reasoning to quit my job and stay on CESB, but I'm wondering what others think. I would still apply to more jobs, just maybe to less high-traffic places, if at all possible.",7,1594163196.0,2020,2020-07-07,CESB Question,satokery,36,hn5bhs

CERB to CESB eligibility periods,"I was eligible for, and received, CERB for the April period. I then got my job back. I make under $1000/month, but that hasn't changed due to covid. This means I was no longer eligible for CERB, but *am* eligible for CESB, and switched over. I just applied for the 3rd CESB period today, which is my 4th period of assistance total.

When I switched over, I was expecting that I would only get 3 cycles of CESB, since 16 weeks was the cap for assistance. This has been extended for CERB, however, and so I'm wondering if I'll be able to collect the 4th cycle of CESB after all. On the CESB application it stated ""16 weeks total"", but I don't know if that's just because that's how long this particular program runs for.

I will be calling CRA; I've just noticed that people get mixed messages from CRA and so I wanted to crowd source a bit, see if anyone else is in this position. Basically, I want to know how to budget this month's cheque, which will be greatly affected by whether I'm getting another one next month.

Question about CESB eligibility,"&#x200B;

So I applied for CESB twice already and about to do some the 3rd time tomorrow, the only thing that worries me is proving I'm looking for work. The thing is I'm with an agency and they usually call me if something comes up, if they need someone at a workplace or anything, I told them I will only work part-time. In the month of June, I worked 1 day at the Mobile Eco center where people can toss their stuff that isnt picked up by the regular garbage trucks. My question is since I'm with an agency that gives me calls when jobs are available, do I still need to be actively looking for a job? I get my payslips by email telling me how much I would be receiving, is that enough proof or what? Any details might help, thanks.

(salary isn't really a problem. i mostly want experience but pay is good especially with whats going on.) and is the position even though it is listed as expereince required is none if they will actually have high expectations for me to have knowledge of certain things even though I am a student since full time or part time is different from internship/coop.",2,1593627203.0,2020,2020-07-01,General Discussion,RurikoWhite,1,hjfobc

CERB to CESB?,"Is there a way to switch from CERB to CESB?

I applied for the CERB thru EI back in March, I thought I had made 5000 last year but checking again, I realized I have not (under by 200$).

I have received $8000 in total from the CERB, and I was thinking of paying back the difference or the overpayment between $8000 and what I would be getting from CESB ($5000). Canada Day is tomorrow and everything will be closed...anyone have any insight?  Thanks so much!

My other issue is that if I have to pay back the 8000$, I can only pay back around 5000 or so because the rest was used on necessities and since my mom went thru surgery right before lockdown and I had extra duties and responsibilities. .

Student looking for job but studying at the same time still qualified for the position and cesb?,"I was quite conflicted of whether I should share and post this but after seeing similar posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CESB/comments/hj1ox4/anyone_else_greatly_struggling_to_get_hired_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), i thought what a place to share and get suggestions from few others who have experience are is going through similar situation.

I am a post-secondary student and before the quarantine, I had hopes of getting some intern/coop position but then quarantine actually happened. turned my plan I had made months before go down the drain. I stopped looking for intern positions and decided to do summer courses. cause i thought that was the most logical thing to do. then cesb came and although it great and aims to provide some help, I am now required to look for jobs on top of doing summer courses to be eligible. (and also i'm kind of paranoid about if I am eligible are not even though i know all i would have to do is just return the money if i was not actually eligible)

I have been doing some 'job search activities' but not frequently (due to the courses) and have been attending webinars, open houses (online of course), and quiz related to job and skill. I was somewhat concerned because if I had applied to any jobs (after filtering for very little experience), and if I was really qualified for the position (computer programming related position). but another part of me is just saying 'just do it'.

Internship/coop is different from some other actual job positions since they know that you wouldn't know much and are there to learn (of course you would need to know some minimum knowledge when applying)

i didn't apply to any positions so far and had just been collecting job posts from job banks (notification via email thing), and filtering for intern positions in other job search sites while doing summer courses and occasionally do resume/cover letter/interview webinars/quizzes.

So I guess what i am asking is, am i doing enough to still be eligible for cesb? or do I have to do more? and is there a specific frequency I have to be 'actively' job searching?",2,1593582224.0,2020,2020-07-01,General Discussion,RurikoWhite,4,hj4d8r

CERB/CESB for self-employed tutor,"I just completed my M.Sc. degree in December 2019. Since January, I have been working as a private tutor for various university courses while looking for other employment. In the couple months before March 15th, I was making about $1400/month from private tutoring (working about 40 hours/month.) Starting on March 16th, I had to self-isolate for 14 days as I had just returned from a short trip to California, and then a few days later all of the universities moved their courses online. I told all of my students that I was happy to switch to online tutoring, but almost half of them declined my offer. Most of my remaining students didn't request as much help because their midterms were now completely open-book. I should have continued working until April 25th, but because final exams were either optional or cancelled, my last day of tutoring for the semester was April 8th.

From March 15th to April 11th, I worked 30 hours and made less than $900. From April 12th to May 9th, I made less than $100. Since my hours were reduced due to COVID and I was making less than $1000 during both of these periods, I applied for and received the CERB (I met all other eligibility criteria just fine.)

I haven't had any luck finding a permanent job yet, so I have continued doing private tutoring. From May 10th to June 6th, I worked about 20 hours and made just under $600, and the next 4-week period looks like it will be similar. However, I have hesitated to apply for the CERB for these periods. There are usually fewer students during the summer semesters, and so it wouldn't be unreasonable to expect less demand for tutoring in general. I feel like the government might look for any reason to get people to repay their CERB cheques, and I think they might see this as a reduction in hours that is no longer due to COVID.

If I don't apply for the CERB, I certainly qualify for the CESB. I just want to make sure I apply for the right one so I don't get penalized later. Is anyone else in a similar situation? Or can anyone offer any insight? I just want to avoid spending a long time waiting on the phone unless it's absolutely necessary.

Am I Elgible?,"Hi! I just graduated from high school and was planning to work this summer. I've never had a real job and have never filed an income tax. I'm confused because I was reading the requirements, and it says I am required to have filed at least 1 income tax prior to applying. However, when I called in to ask, I was given a number to call on the day that I am able to apply. 

My questions:

1. Do I need my CRA account to apply?
2. Do I need to have filed an income tax before?
3. Do I just call that number without setting anything up?
4. Is anyone else in this situation?

Updates on people who mailed their physical CERB cheques back?,"I mailed my physical CERB cheque back after realizing I didn't qualify for it earlier in the month. 

At the time, I was instructed by the CRA website to mail it back to their Sudbury location, so I did.

I've been calling CRA agents recently to figure out if they've processed the return yet and I've learned that I needed to send it back to their Montreal location. This isn't a problem apparently as the cheque will get mailed to that location eventually but I've been waiting for close to a month for the request to process. 

For context I mailed the original cheque back around the 9th of June and still no word. I called today and was told by an agent to call back in around 2 weeks.

I’m very confused and need help!!!,"In April I applied for CERB via Ei (service Canada) I was off for one month due to being quarantined as my mom got tested and my work ( retirement home) wanted me to self isolate for 14 days so the whole process took about 1 month. The EI people sent $4000 one payment of $2000 and then two payments of $1000... I now know I need to pay back $2000 before December because I should it have gotten two payments. However Ei is saying I would owe back all $4000 because I didn’t use 16 weeks of benefits? Now fast forward I reduced my hours at my job because I was hoping to volunteer at a hospital this summer( and can’t work at a hospital and retirement home at the same time) but that doesn’t seem like it’s happening, so I’m making less then $1000 a month, so I would qualify for cesb I verified this with agent at CRA and service Canada but I don’t qualify for CERB in this case.... I am applying to more jobs since my my volunteering didn’t happen... but I wanted to apply for the cesb so I called the CRA they said terminate the EI claim.. so I tried calling the initial guy said I would owe back $3500 if I did that and was better off on CERB (but I don’t qualify) then I called back today and the lady said it was not possible to cancel ei to apply for cesb and I should just apply for CERB and only use $1250 which would be the cesb amount!

Switching from EIERB/CERB to CESB finally works today!!!!,"Hi!! I have been trying to switch from EIERB/CERB to CESB for months now. I can finally say that I have been able to and you can to! So basically I received EIERB through service canada before the student benefit came out and realized that I am definitely more suited for the student one and I wasnt even sure if i was 100% eligible for the EIERB/CERB. I only received one payment of EIERB and it was not in any of the same eligibility periods as CESB. After two months of calling Service Canada I had finally got my claim terminated but I WAS STILL BLOCKED TO APPLY FOR CESB. So frustrating. I heard this June 24th rumour so I decided to wait and call then. I called ‭1 (800) 959-8281 today and it took about 15 mins to do this‬ , clicked the option for cerb/cesb and then clicked the general inquiries option to speak to someone. First person I spoke too was no help at all and had no clue what I was saying. If that happens to you call again and hope to get a different person because there is no wait and you should get a person who understands at least once. I called again and got a different person. Told them my situation and that I was trying to apply for CESB but could not since I have applied for EIERB/CERB before and it was blocking it. I was transferred to someone told them i am returning my EIERB payment and no longer receiving that and they applied for me and I will now be getting my two missed CESB periods. BTW my claim was terminated but you can still do this even if your claim was not terminated. Hopefully this helps. I know how frustrating it is.

"Update for anyone trying to terminate their CERB claim to get CESB (not eligible for CERB, but I am for CESB)","After getting my calls escalated until the last escalation I believe (5th one), an EI agent from the upper levels called me and this is what is going to happen if you applied for CERB, realized you didn't qualify, and now are trying to get CESB: 

1. you need to keep calling to get your calls escalated so someone higher can call you. It's long and can be frustrating to wait on the phone just to explain the same situation over and over again but because you keep calling, once the upper agents call you, they recognize that you are aware you made a mistake by applying and are trying to fix it so they will do everything they can for this to happen. So keep calling!
2. For the full 4 months period, we can receive up to 5000, so claim your CERB through EI up to that amount and then stop. If you claimed more already, I am in the same boat. I claimed 6000$, which means there will be an overpayment of 1000$. However, because I am starting a new job on Thursday, I will also have to pay an overpayment for July and August, and I believe I can keep June since I won't be making 1000$ a month yet. 
3. They CANNOT terminate the claim. They told me it would be put on hold for now, so if I get laid off work (which by then I would have reached the 5000$ criteria for CERB) I would be able to apply for CERB in the future if needed. 
4. Because you recognize your mistake and take the steps necessary to ""try and cancel it"", you will not be penalized. If you were not eligible for CERB, you had until December to pay it back with no penalty. Now, with those steps taken, your claim will be reevaluated and recalculated to be processed as CESB for the periods you were eligible. You won't be penalized except that you will have to repay the overpayment.
5. The EI agent made sure to note all of that in my file so that if there is any issues, it is written in my file that this is what I was told to do and that there should not be penalties. This is why it is important you keep escalating your calls till you get a higher EI agent as I believe they are the only ones that can work on this issue and they will make sure it is in your file and that your claim gets sent for reevaluation in the future. 
6. I did ask about the June 24th update, how we will be able to apply to CESB by phone through CRA. He told me his instructions were not to repay the full amount, and that it was 100% okay with the process that I did. Now, if you already repaid it, you can call on the phone for CESB, but for anyone that is wondering what to do, if you have got that money already and don't wanna go through the CRA process and paying it back, keep escalating your calls so they can reevaluate your EI CERB claim and modify it later into the CESB requirement claim.  

&#x200B;

This is the information I got from an upper EI agent after he called me. I am not saying other people did not get different directions, but this is what I will do as he seemed pretty confident about it and worst comes to worst I will have to fight it later if there are issues, but I really don't think/hope there will be by what he told me his instructions were. If you have more details, feel free to add to this or if you have any questions I can try and help but I am no expert :)",3,1592940037.0,2020,2020-06-23,CESB Discussion,Timbits0422,0,hel25h

Please Helppp,"Please help

Hi I have applied for EI on late March before CERB came out. At that point my 2019 income was $4600 but at the start I didn’t realize that I was not eligible but during the application I realized that I wouldn’t be able to get the EI. So I just finished the application just let it be not submitting any ROE nor any reports. But I still got $2000 on April and I am keeping them to return it. However, I got a little hour job (less than $1000 a month) now I am over $5000 for the last 12 months before application. 
I was trying to terminate EI and apply for CESB but the termination isnt going well because they are busy as hell and Im just sitting on a throne waiting. 

But since my income is over 5000 for the last 12 months before application (I started working mid 2019) am I eligible for EI or CERB? 

Should I wait til termination or just submit the reports for EI and receiving it while I am waiting. 

Will I be missing any money? I didnt apply to anything since that March EI application. 

Thank you!!!!",1,1592493153.0,2020,2020-06-18,CESB Question,BeopDdak,1,hbggpf

I was just told that they arent going to be canceling any claims anytime soon which means we will not be able to pay for the student benefit for the time being, however, I was told that we can keep the money we have recieved from EIERB up to the amount we qualify for the CESB and pay back the remainder whenever they work on overdraft repayments down the line.
They told me to complete extra weeks of reports if I qualify for more than I have recieved.
They put on my file that I was told this in case there are any issues down the line, so I recommend calling or submitting a service request based on this so it can be added to yours just to be safe.

Would I have to pay back my CESB?,"So I'm always a little paranoid about things, but even after talking with a CRA agent and browsing all the FAQS etc, I cant really get a solid answer. Sorry if this is a long post, just giving context.

I'm a grad student, full time, so I'm currently in the midst of my research. My monthly expenses are $1200 (if i basically don't eat or shop for anything)-1400 (somewhat healthy groceries, shopping once in a while, etc). During the fall and winter terms, I TA, so I get supplemental income during those terms. I also get an RA, which is meant to cover the cost of my research (it doesn't, the university expects you to TA as well, but yknow, no big).

My summer RA/month is about $1100, which I thought made me ineligible for CESB. BUT after talking with the CRA agent, we found out that my RA is listed as an honorarium, so I get a T4A slip, not a T4, and thus doesn't count as employment income. So according to her, I make nothing. So I applied and recieved the CESB for the last 2 sessions.

Without covid, I would have normally looked for a part-time summer job or maybe tried to get another TA position for summer to cover my remaining expenses. Since I'm still a full-time student working on my research, I can't exactly take on a regular full time job. Covid and quarantine has also exacerbated my anxiety and especially my depression, to the point where somedays, the only thing I can manage is getting a glass of water. I did make a job bank account once I got my CESB and looked in my area (a small-medium sized town) and found nothing that would work for me.

I know the 3 main criteria for CESB eligibility are : unable to work, actively seeking work but unable to find it, or working but making less than $1000. Basically, I'm worrying that my situation isn't good enough and I would have to repay my CESB. Is being a full-time grad student with pretty bad depression because of covid, and who can't find the specific part-time/casual work needed enough to get CESB? And how would I prove it if the CRA asks? The CRA agent said having my T4A would be one way to show my $1100 isn't employment income, but I'm more wondering about how I prove I can't work.",5,1592352491.0,2020,2020-06-16,CESB Question,Trying_My_Best_26,7,hag1ya

Full-time Student Grants count toward 5000 for EI_CERB? CESB vs CERB,"I applied to EI in march and my claim was rejected for insufficient hours. A month later I received a letter from Service Canada, which said they have re-examined my claim and they have determined I am eligible for EI-CERB, and they deposited an advanced $2000 into my bank. I called them trying to explain that I did not make $5000 in income in 2019 nor in the past 12 months, and I requested my claim to be canceled so I can apply for CESB.

&#x200B;

Today, I received a call from Service Canada, and the agent told me that I am eligible for EI-CERB and I should continue filling EI-ERB bi-weekly reports. But then when I told him about the 5000 income rule, he asked if I have had any more income other than my only two jobs (which paid a total of $3800 in the past 12 months), and I said I got full-time student grants from government along side my student loans. He told me the **grants** **count** toward income.

The CERB website says ""Pensions, student loans and bursaries are not considered employment income and should not be included.""

&#x200B;

Should I start filling reports and get the CERB or not? I am so confused. I do not want to be told to return the CERB money at tax season, because I would have missed on the CESB that I know for sure am eligible.",5,1592331721.0,2020,2020-06-16,General Discussion,Environmental-Door18,0,ha9jbi

Anyone else still unable to apply for CESB because of an unterminated EICERB application?," Here is some backstory:

I  originally applied for EICERB back in March but then later realized I  was not qualified and so I immediately tried to cancel my application. I  had already received a couple of direct deposits from EI and so I tried to return the money. I called Service Canada and they told me that they do not accept or take money, they only hand it out and I had to send it  back to the CRA. I called the CRA and they told me that since I applied through Service Canada, I had to send the money there.

I  got tired of being sent in circles so I sent the money through my bank to the CRA as a 2020 tax installment payment. This was what I saw others do online so I decided to do it myself. Once again on a call with the  CRA, the agent tells me that they cannot process the transfer and that it has to be sent to Service Canada. Service Canada currently has no option anywhere to send them money or pay them back. The CRA agent tells me that he will transfer it on my behalf to Service Canada. At this point, I just say thanks and hope the transfer works. It's been a month and that money is still sitting in my CRA account and I am still unable to apply for CESB.

So the two questions I want to ask are:

1. Has anyone been able to pay back their EICERB money?
2. Has anyone successfully switched over from  EICERB to CESB?

- I have a disability but it's not one that prevents my working (it's just I have an IEP)
- I have two dependent children, 1 and 2
- daycares remain closed in my region
- one child has medical issues that requires doctor visits and I'm the only one in my family who drives
- I live with my spouse, not parents
- I was in school Sept-Apr full time, Apr-July (i.e. now) full time, will be part time Sept-Apr coming up
- I was not previously employed before COVID but received OSAP. We own our home so I do not pay rent

I applied for the job bank and made a resume but haven't done anything else yet. I read that those with dependents without childcare are a special situation that needs consideration and I'm not expected to be looking for work, is that true? I'm going off of info I find in this subreddit.

I've received the two CESB payments thus far and I justify it that I'm able to work but there's nothing in my field that's remote work and I can't travel for work due to my dependent situation.

I just don't know how to make sense of how my situation is handled. I need to show proof I'm looking for work but it really has to be remote work and there's nothing like that near me. What should I be doing right now?",2,1592247839.0,2020,2020-06-15,CESB Question,AlbatrossFront,1,h9mkk3

"Is simply living with someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 enough, or do you have to actively be ""caring"" for them?","I have what may seem like a weird question, but I think it's a legitimate one.  

A couple days ago [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/CESB/comments/h7l3lm/backgrounder_updates_unable_to_work_looking_for/) was created to summarize the new additions to the [CESB Backgrounder](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/news/2020/05/backgrounder-the-canada-emergency-student-benefit.html).   

According to the thread, the OP of the post stated that ""You are taking care of someone who is in quarantine or has Covid or you live with someone who is vulnerable to Covid"" is a valid reason for being unable to work. Now I'm not sure if OP had this sentence copied and pasted from the Backgrounder page, but currently the backgrounder says this: ""Individuals providing care to others include - those living with someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 (adults over the age of 65; underlying health conditions, etc.)""  

So my question is, is simply living with someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 enough, or do you have to actively be ""caring"" for them? I'm not exactly sure what ""caring"" for them would mean nor how would the government be able to prove this. Like for example, both my parents have been diagnosed with hypertension and they take medication for it every single day. But I don't ""care"" for them in anyway - i.e. they are fully capable of functioning on their own but we do live under the same roof and share the same house supplies and utilities.

CSSG INFO (copy/pasted from the pdf),"**I Want to Help**

We need Canadian students’ help to build a stronger tomorrow. The global COVID-19 pandemic has created economic and social challenges for post-secondary students and recent graduates. The coronavirus has negatively impacted learning and employment opportunities this summer and beyond. Canadian students are concerned about the impact on their ability to further their studies, save for their education and secure future employment.  At the same time, Canadian not-for-profits face notable disruptions to the essential community services they provide.  The not-for-profit sector has been experiencing a reduction in support from volunteers due to Canadians following stay-at-home guidance. This has left many not-for-profits having to shift program delivery to focus on technology-driven support, and they are seeking volunteers with the skills and interest to support in this way.  In response, the Government of Canada has created the Canada Student Service Grant (CSSG), a program that will provide thousands of qualified post-secondary students with learning and volunteer opportunities to address relevant COVID-19 challenges at Canadian not-for-profits during summer 2020. Students participating will be eligible to apply for a grant, which will provide up to $5,000 to be used towards post-secondary education costs. The grant is based on the number of validated volunteer hours completed between June 15 and September 15, 2020. Student volunteers receiving the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) ($1,250 monthly) are also eligible to apply for a CSSG. All volunteer placements are facilitated in a way to respect social distancing and other health and safety precautions established by the Public Health Agency of Canada while removing participation barriers. The CSSG is bilingual, accessible and inclusive to help ensure participation from Canadians from coast to coast to coast, including those from Indigenous communities and other underrepresented groups. 

&#x200B;

**How the CSSG benefits students**

The CSSG is designed so that qualified post-secondary 

students and recent graduates can pursue a variety 

of volunteer opportunities that put their interests and 

abilities to work for a not-for-profit cause this summer. 

This allows students to give back while they gain skills, 

experience and much more, including:

• The opportunity to do meaningful volunteer work 

and give back in an intentional way.

• Skills development with LinkedIn Learning.

• Role and skills training.

• Connection to community.

• All volunteer placements are designed to respect social distancing and other health and safety precautions established by the Public Health Agency of Canada.

• Eligibility to apply for the Canada Student Service Grant (CSSG) to use towards post-secondary education. The CSSG is in addition to the Canada Emergency Student Benefit ($1,250 monthly). Students receiving the $1,250 monthly CESB benefit are eligible for CSSG. However, students receiving the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) ($2,000 monthly) are ineligible to receive the CSSG.

 

**CSSG eligibility** 

1. To be considered an eligible student, a  person must:

• be enrolled and attending post-secondary education (PSE) during spring/summer 2020 and/or September 2020; or 

• have graduated from PSE no earlier than December 2019; and

• be a Canadian citizen, permanent resident, registered Indian or have refugee status.  

2. Domicile:

• International students are not eligible. 

• Canadian students who study abroad but are currently residing in Canada, and do their volunteer hours in Canada, are eligible.

3. No age restrictions:

• All students, regardless of age, who meet the eligibility criteria will receive the CSSG.

4. Post-secondary education includes:

• Part-time or full-time study over a period of at least 12 weeks which must be in pursuit of a degree, diploma or certificate at an accredited institution. Accredited institutions are universities, colleges and Indigenous learning institutions accredited by the province or territory in which they are located. 

**CSSG Eligibility of Students Receiving Other Income Benefits**

1. The following students are eligible:

• those receiving the Canada Emergency Student Benefit ($1,250 monthly); 

• those who are employed; and 

• students can use their microgrant hours towards the CSSG OR a microgrant stipend but not both. If you apply for a microgrant and choose not to receive the stipend, you may be able to use your microgrant hours for a stipend and your volunteer placement hours towards the CSSG.

2. The following students are ineligible:

• Students who are receiving, or who have received at any time, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit 

(CERB) ($2,000 monthly), are not eligible to receive the CSSG. Students will be required to attest that they have at no time been in receipt of the CERB.  

**Disbursement of the CSSG**

• Applicants must register by the deadline of August 8, 2020 in order to receive the CSSG .

• The CSSG will be paid in a lump-sum amount based on the number of validated volunteer hours that an applicant has completed between Monday June 15, 2020, and Tuesday September 15, 2020. 

• The five levels of CSSG disbursement amounts are as follows: 

• 100 hours for $1,000. 

• 200 hours for $2,000. 

• 300 hours for $3,000.

• 400 hours for $4,000.

• 500 hours for $5,000.

• Applicants must reach the minimum number of hours for each threshold (e.g. an applicant who submits 270 hours is only eligible to receive the $2,000/200 hours level disbursement amount).

• The CSSG will be disbursed to eligible student volunteer applicants within 60 days of receipt of payment from the Government of Canada, unless demand exceeds initial projections and/or for incomplete applications which require further review. Further information will be made available prior to program launch.

**CSSG volunteer opportunities**  

The CSSG program offers a variety of educational volunteer opportunities that will connect post-secondary students with not-for-profit organizations facing challenges due to the COVID-19 crisis in order to build skills and work experience. All volunteer placements are designed to respect social distancing and other health and safety precautions established by the Public Health Agency of Canada. Some examples include: 

*Mental Well-being* 

Mental health and well-being are of utmost importance during these turbulent times. Student volunteers can get involved in projects geared towards the support of increasing connections and building community despite the challenges presented by mandated physical distancing as a result of COVID-19. Peer-to-Peer Mentorship & Educational Support This is where the student becomes the teacher. Student volunteers can be paired with younger students in elementary, middle or secondary school who need additional educational support as a result of their academic studies being paused due to COVID-19. Both the mentors and students can develop their academic and communication skills. 

*Arts & Culture*

Do you believe the arts have the power to advance change and produce a better society during a challenging situation? This is an opportunity to create something inspiring to share with the community while building verbal communication and creative writing skills. Examples may include interviewing and writing stories on behalf of seniors who have been isolated by COVID-19, to celebrate their lives and achievements, and share their wisdom and knowledge through the creation of an inter-generational capsule of community stories. 

*Advocacy & Outreach* 

Interested in a career in media, communications or public relations? As not-for-profits do their part to help flatten the curve, student volunteers can support a not-for-profit’s outreach efforts—and in many cases, create a new digital platform—through online marketing research, planning, creative services, social media engagement and multimedia content creation. 

*COVID-19 Safe Ambassador Training*

Want to help communicate how a not-for-profit organization is being affected by COVID-19 and exercise leadership skills by mentoring others and members in your community? Through a ‘train the trainer’ approach, volunteers will be trained on critical social issues, pertinent to a specific not-for-profit, which are especially relevant at this challenging time (e.g., anti-bullying, literacy, mental health). They will share their knowledge in one-to-one mentorship sessions with members in their community and help them develop personalized action plans.",24,1591990447.0,2020,2020-06-12,General Discussion,novachrono55,24,h7rgun

Was the CESB Backgrounder Modified on what unable to work means?,"I was reading the CESB backgrounder last night and I noticed that it says it was modified June 10, 2020. Is this new information? as it seems that they actually explained what unable to work means by specifying: 

The reason for being “unable to work” must be related to COVID-19. Such reasons could include being in quarantine or ill, taking care of someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 or taking care of dependants while their school or care facility is closed.

Individuals in self-isolation/quarantine include:

• those who have tested positive for COVID-19 or are symptomatic and cannot otherwise physically or virtually attend work; and

•those with underlying health conditions (heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, compromised immune system) who would face increased risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19.

Individuals providing care to others include:

•those taking care of others who are in quarantine or sick due to COVID-19;

•those living with someone who is vulnerable to COVID-19 (adults over the age of 65; underlying health conditions, etc.); and

•those taking care of children because their care facility or school is closed due to COVID-19.

In addition, students studying abroad are considered “unable to work” if:

• they are only authorized to work on campus, had been looking for work on campus but were unable to find it; and

•they contacted the Canadian Embassy to be repatriated and are waiting to return to Canada.

Struggling to apply for work as a full time student without a car,"I'm just wondering if anyone else is in the same boat as me. I'm currently a full-time student who is taking online classes, and although I have access to public transportation, I don't have a car. 

I find it very frustrating that summer students seem to have been forgotten about regarding the CESB and job searching. I cannot work full-time, and even part-time I'd only be able to work a very limited amount of hours that most places just aren't looking for. On top of that, there's not much available in my area (even though I'm downtown) and the farthest I'm willing to travel is around 30 minutes on the bus. I also have very limited job experience. 

For all of these reasons, job searching has been a nightmare and I've only applied to 2 jobs because nothing else was suitable for me and my situation. I'm honestly quite worried I'm going to end up audited or some shit because of my lack of applications, even though I'm logging in and searching the Job Bank daily. I'm almost wondering if it would be better if I just started applying for things I know I don't qualify for in order to start beefing up my job application spreadsheet...",2,1591832240.0,2020,2020-06-10,CESB Discussion,intergalacticdisco,29,h0n9l1

The tories are doing something that I can support for once. 

I know that this applies to CERB only and not CESB, but I think this is significant because if this bill had passed, then CESB would probably have been next on the liberal's list.

Update on the EI/CERB Claim Termination Issue,I just got off the phone with service canada and after a 2 hour wait I was told that right now they have been told they are not terminating claims (even if already previously requested) and have been told to not push anymore termination requests as they will not be done. Thought I would save some people the 2 hours on hold. Right now the only hope is the rumour that on the 24th we would be able to manually apply. But the agent did tell me that she gets calls all day everyday about this issue and says it is being talked about. We just have to wait I guess.,38,1591802533.0,2020,2020-06-10,,Corrupt3dz,11,h0d29z

Resolved Today! I was unable to apply for CESB due to existing EI-CERB claim with Service Canada,"Good news all, I just had my case resolved after weeks of phone calls with Service Canada. This is the solution given to me. According to their counselor, once an EI-CERB claim has been accepted into the system, there is **no built-in way** to remove or terminate the claim itself. Meaning that i won't be able to directly apply for CESB through MyCRA. However, I am to keep doing my reports with EI-CERB until i reach $5K which is the maximum amount I can get from CESB.  



This whole process took roughly 3 weeks, and 6 escalation calls. This is my timeline
 
>May 20th: Call 1 - Case made, call back 5 business days if not resolved 


>May 28th: Call 2 - Case escalated to level 2, call back 2 business days if not resolved


>June 2nd: Call 3 - Case escalated to level 3, call back 1 business day if not resolved 


>June 4th: Call 4 - Case escalated to level 4, bought to regional contacts due to high case level, call back 1 business day if not resolved


>June 8th: Call 5 - Case escalated to level 5 (highest level), Assigned to agent and sent to regional processing, call back 1 business day if not resolved


>June 10th: Call 6 - Case remained at level 5 but a reminder sent to the agent, I received a call back shortly after saying that the case is worked on, about an hour later I received another phone call saying that the case has been resolved


Essentially they'll be giving me the amount of CERB that I was supposed to be getting all at once (I have 9 weeks of untouched reports), and I will not make any more reports after getting my 10 weeks of CERB payment. They reassured me that a note has been made on my file so that CRA isn't going to be causing trouble next year over it, this is their current procedure in resolving this issue for those stuck in this situation. So good news to everyone stuck in the same boat, keep escalating those calls because due to high volume of cases only the ones at max escalation are being looked at at present! 


PS: At first, the hold times were 1-2 hours, but I find that if you call the number at 8:25 and get through their automated messages, and hit connect at 8:30 when they open, the wait times are super short, less than 10 minutes, it will help your sanity",24,1591800605.0,2020,2020-06-10,CESB Discussion,bssbronzie,8,h0cj47

What to do with OSAP application when you find a job while on CESB,"I was called for an interview for this coming Monday (nothing fancy, fast food part time,better than nothing at this point) I'm wondering how's my OSAP application gonna be like.

 I applied osap as soon as the application open for fall term 2020-2021 and I put NO to the question saying""

 
""If you expect to earn or receive any other income totalling more than $11,200 during your study period (Sep 1/20 to Apr 16/21) (e.g., income from employment, Teaching or Research Assistantships, child support and/or spousal support, foster parent payments, rental income, investment income including interest and dividends) report the full amount here. 
What income to include 
No  ""

 Did i answerit right?.To my understanding, i am not earning $11,200 during that study period and the threshold per term is $5,600 according to osap website. I won't be earning $5,600 per term and if working part time with weekends only it will only come up to $3,360 per term, with total of $ 6,720 for the whole study period year(2terms)
My question are: 

1. What do i do with my OSAP Application regarding the $0 amount that i put in income earn during study period? ( if i get hired)
2. In regards to CESB , I applied for part time weekends only and i have received the $$ for the 2nd round just now (june10) , how does CESB work if i ever get hired? I can still continue to work as long as I earn less than 1k right?",7,1591799854.0,2020,2020-06-10,,HopefulCartographer9,2,h0cam0

Am I still eligible if I deny a job I had because of new work conditions,"I had a summer job at a camp, most other camp organizations closed their camps form this summer except mine.  This isn't  a issue but they released new guidelines for work and safety which are a bit questionable to say the least.   Not to mention I already have parents that are in their 60s with preexisting health conditions.  Will I become ineligible if I turn down this current job offer, but I will continue to apply for other jobs with more favorable work and safety regulations.

Edit/ Update:.  I personally just quit my job after trying to find a statement about quitting an offered job.  I technically never started work since the summer camp was going to start running the next week.  I figured to quit prior to them making an explicit statement about my question.  But I'll still be looking and applying for work.  I also have a couple grants lined up so those may count as well.",5,1591638852.0,2020,2020-06-08,CESB Question,CripCripCripp,3,gz474j

I'm wondering if it's because I didn't file my taxes by the June 1 deadline.

Did anyone else? I've been on hold for almost an hour and a half and have an online meeting in 15 minutes so I may have to hang up on CRA.

And I just don't know what to do because everything is chaotic and it's only adding to my anxiety knowing I missed out on something so important.

Service Canada EI/CERB Termination issues,"So I've been trying to terminate my EI claim after realizing i'm not eligible, but they still granted it to me. I only applied since on the website it says ""We encourage you to apply for benefits so our processing agents can determine if you are eligible."" 

So after over a month and a half of being on hold with CRA & Service Canada I still haven't had any luck with fully terminating the claim and i'm in my 4th escalation with Service Canada at the moment.

I also saw other reddit posts saying on June 10th or June 24th we should be able to manually apply for CESB even if we have an existing EI claim. And after just speaking to two CRA agents, they old me this isnt true. They said the June 24 date is ""for people have have applied for CERB but they should have applied for CESB""

I was just worried that i'll miss the first eligibility period and only get 3 periods rather than 4. So i was wondering if anyone is in the same position as me & if anyone has had any success with Service Canada.",27,1591363811.0,2020,2020-06-05,General Discussion,Judegomess,9,gx4lhn

Sorry opposition parties but Covid19 is spreading on Farms,"**EDIT:** This is in regards to the creation of the CESB and how it went down as we had followed it. The complaint by two opposition parties was that farms wouldn't have the workers so students need to fill these positions and the CESB acts as a disincentive since it was originally created as a ""handout"" (in their viewpoint). Students who heard about this were immediately afraid of the prospect, while some wouldn't mind, most were worried about covid-19 and that working at farms could be more dangerous.

**EDIT:** Apparently there are some on Social Media that don't want migrant workers but want students to work farms....I wonder why?

All the whining in the Senate and HoC. While it was a unanimous vote sure the two opposition parties were so worried about farms (the main reason for the job search requirement) well look at this

I applied for EI, received CERB, paid back through CRA option on website, and I CANNOT close my account with EI to apply for CESB? Please, if anyone has done this, let us know! I have called many times, every time they say they are escalating my call and will have someone call me back. This never happens. No one on any phone number is able to do anything and no one has updated us yet.

My last EI payment wasApril 25. My next report, for the period beginning April 26 is now due but I have stopped doing reports. If my file goes dormant, and I have paid back the money to CRA, will I be able to apply for CESB?

UPDATE

I got through to Service Canada (finally). They are aware of the issue, returning the money from EIERB is fine, they will contact me when they have a solution.

Panic Disorder/Anxiety Disorder as Disability?,"Hey all, sorry about the lengthy wall of text, I'm trying to include a lot of detail and I'm pretty bad at being concise.

I have newly developed anxiety and panic attacks (likely from stressing over the pandemic) and feel like I can't work or seek jobs right now. The anxiety has been there since the pandemic started, which I saw as a normal reaction, but last week I had a panic attack so bad I thought I was having a heart attack (shortness of breath, extremely rapid heart rate, heart palpitations, tingling and sharp pains in neck/body, dizzy and couldn't see, nearly fainted) and went to the ER in an ambulance 'cause I felt like I was going to die. I've had anxiety (without panic attacks) and depression years before and had been on medication around age 19-20 but I've managed it fine without medication or therapy for some years now, it just seems the pandemic stress has awoken something that was long dormant. I applied for the first CESB already but took the regular $1250 rather than the $2000 for disability.

So I have a few questions: is anxiety/panic disorder a valid reason to not work/seek work? Should I switch over to the disability CESB or continue on regular? Are those on the disability CESB expected to look for work to the same extent as the regular CESB? Will anxiety/panic disorder qualify as a disability? 

I'm especially stressed about having to find a job since my anxiety is exacerbated from thinking about the pandemic, so working with the public is off the table for me as I want to avoid these panic attacks as much as possible. I'm also enrolled in online summer courses through my University which I attend lecture 4 days a week on Zoom, so I can only really apply for part-time jobs. Also, I'm an anglophone living in Montreal which is another issue in qualifying for many jobs.

I'm thinking of asking my former employer to rehire me but put me on a leave of absence because I have school and am dealing with mental health issues, we had a good relationship when I left so hopefully they will be understanding and let me return to work when I am healthy again. So another question: will being employed but on leave make me exempt from having to look for work for the CESB? This seems like my preferred option because I don't want to apply to a new job where I would have to start working immediately as I really need to seek mental health treatment before I re-enter the workforce.

I know everyone is stressed about the pandemic so I hope I don't come across as selfish for not wanting to work, but I honestly don't think I can handle it and think the stress would ruin my academic success in my summer courses.",7,1590856530.0,2020,2020-05-30,CESB Question,pumpsy2000,5,gth31u

Backgrounder Updates: Mature Students and New Definitions,"Please check the backgrounder. It has been updated with some new information in the last few days. It expands / clarifies the definition of high school (HS) graduate and post secondary students (PSE) and speaks to documentation required for mature students. Please read the page for yourself. My interpretation is that those eligible include:

1. Current PSE students - you took courses (at least 12 weeks in length) leading to a degree, diploma or certificate at an approved institution in winter 2020 or spring / summer 2020. Part-time and Full-time students are both eligible.

2. You graduated PSE in December 2019 or left PSE studies in Dec 2019 or later - you will need to have documents showing you attended classes or wrote exams between Dec 2019 and Aug 31st, 2020 or you completed your program or graduated in Dec 2019

3. You are a new PSE student who was not enrolled in HS in 2020. You have been accepted to a PSE program that meets the criteria (12 weeks, degree, diploma or certificate, approved institution) and will be starting by Feb 1st, 2021. You  will need to have documents (down the road) showing acceptance of admission to your program before the start of the CESB period for which you apply and and showing you attended a PSE program by Feb 1st, 2021

4. You graduated high school in 2020 and have applied to attend a PSE program that starts before Feb 1st, 2021. Graduation has been defined to mean all grades are finalized before the first day of the CESB period. Once all grades are finalized and you have applied for admission to a PSE program that starts prior to Feb 1, 2021, you can apply for whatever CESB periods remain.

$1000/month is so arbitrary,"Hi, just a rant.  


I thought I was smart, getting 2 part-time jobs for extra income during the summer. But just my luck, I make $1,100 before taxes. So I make $900 LESS than if I quit my 2nd job and applied to CESB. That's BS, why would the government incentivize me to quit my job? How is that beneficial to the economy in any way!   


I'm actually going to quit. I don't accept that I should be paid less for working more.",27,1590762429.0,2020,2020-05-29,CESB Discussion,LegitimateBet0,32,gstyva

Realizing to have qualified for the disability amount,"There were discussions about students who have applied for the $1,250 benefit for this period but actually should have applied for the disability benefit for $2000.

According to [this locked thread (Info: claiming a disability)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CESB/comments/gknbif/info_claiming_a_disability/):

>**4.  I already submitted my application without realizing I qualify for the  disability amount. Can I repay the $1250 that I'm given and then reapply  as a person with a disability for the same eligibility period?**  
>  
>*Yes.  It's best to do this online through CRA My Account. It may take a few  days for the repayment to go through before you can reapply.*

I followed through, returned the $1,250 and tried to re-apply. I've had my repayment processed since May 19th and I still did not have an option to apply for this period as it said, I have already applied. Today I called the CRA (the CERB/CESB line and the general: 1-800-959-8281) and the general line helped me through, but she said she could not edit my benefit to the disability one, and she does not think there are any other options to revert back to clean slate and reapply as disabled. However, the option she had was to process a return of my repayment so I get the $1,250 back and suggested making sure to apply for disability benefit next time.

So I'll be getting back the $1,250 through direct deposit in 10+ days.

I hope this somewhat helps and has anybody successfully changed their benefits to the disability amount?

EDIT: they also deemed that repaying the $1,250 to be able to re-apply for $2000 disability amount was a ""misinformation."" I told her that I knew this information from a CESB discussion online.",3,1590534381.0,2020,2020-05-26,CESB Discussion,camoonies,3,gr7tgg

Any NEW information on CESB for mature/gap year students?,"Has anyone heard any more info? Anything is welcome. I was told by a CRA agent I DO qualify but I don't know how much I believe this because of all the different answers.

Also, my college says I will be enrolled by early August. 

I've emailed a few MPs and haven't heard anything back.

My situation is that I had to get compassion leave due to health issues 2 years ago from my college. I am only just coming back to school as I've gotten a lot of help. I have been job hunting for a while but it's been hard. Thus meaning I graduated highschool years ago and the last time I was in college was 2 years ago.

""New post-secondary students with classes starting on or before February 1, 2021, who were not enrolled in high school in 2020, should have documents showing that:

their application for admission into a post-secondary program was accepted before the four-week CESB period for which they applied.

Furthermore, in future, if requested, they must provide evidence of attending a post-secondary program before February 1, 2021.""

FOR THOSE WANTING TO APPLY FOR CESB AFTER RETURNING YOUR CERB CHEQUES (IT IS POSSIBLE),"Hello people of Reddit. I thought I’d give my personal experience as a way to soothe your nerves. I know a lot of people are stressed out because they don’t know if their cheque/return will be processed in time to apply for CESB. 

A little bit of background information: I applied for 2 periods of CERB on April 21 after filing my taxes because I was told I was eligible by my tax guy (spoiler: I wasn’t)

Less than 10 business days later I had received 2 cheques in the mail. After doing a bunch of research online and countless of reddit searches I realized I wasn’t eligible and sent back the money the next day via postal services. 

April 30: Send back the money to CRA however I forgot to put in my sin number and reason of return (which is important for later)

May 6: my envelope got delivered to the CRA

We’re going to skip the countless of hours I spent calling the CRA last week because it didn’t really bring me anywhere. 

Today May 25: I had received an email from the CRA at 4:34 am saying: “The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) recently sent MY NAME paper mail but it was returned to us. 

Please log in to My Account to review and update your mailing address. 

If you do not have My Account, go to the CRA web page to register.” 

So I called them. The lady on the phone told me that because it was returned and I hadn’t given any reason for the return the CRA basically thinks it was due to the fact that I wasn’t living at that address anymore and thus had to give my new address. Which means that they might send the cheques back, but she made sure to put in my file that it was just a refund since I wasn’t eligible. So she updated the information on my profile and said that the returned cheques will show up in my 2020 payments/reimbursement. Since I still wasn’t able to apply on the website I applied through the phone. Now it shows on my profile that I applied for the first period of CESB. It still shows that I applied for CERB (the two periods), but that should be fixed soon. The payments should be deposited in my bank account in 3 business days.

Sorry for the lengthy post. I hope this helps a few of you. If you have any questions feel free to ask them.

On the back there is a stamp that says to offer ID when you cash the cheque so I was not sure if the Teller was the only option. I much prefer depositing it through the ATM to maintain social distancing from the Teller. My question is- has anyone successfully cashed their cheque through an ATM?,14,1590419595.0,2020,2020-05-25,CESB Question,isabellagalb,6,gqcody

"Eligibility Question - University Student that hasn't taken courses since April 2019, enrolled in a course this June-July","Hey Everyone! 

I hope someone could clarify a few things for me please :)

I'm a University Student (in a program), that hasn't worked in a few years (currently looking for job) and I haven't taken any courses at school since April 2019, but I just enrolled in a course for June-July Summer Session on Friday. Am I eligible for CESB? 

If I am, should I apply before June 6th or wait til my course starts in late June?

Since I registered on Friday, how long will it take for me to show up in the system as ""Enrolled""?

"As a student, should I switch to CESB from CERB this window?","I'm a student that works part-time. In the winter of 2020, I was generally working 8-20 hours a week (sometimes working only one shift) in a retail store. Pre-COVID, I would occasionally pick up an extra shift if one is open, since I wasn't working as much as last year. But I was consistently earning less than $1000/month. When COVID-19 came around, I was laid off and I claimed my first two CERB payments because I met the eligibility criteria.

Right now, it is the 3rd window and I have claimed the CERB payment (knowing that I was eligible for CESB), even though I am going back to work in a part-time capacity and I am currently in my summer semester. Upon further research, I am still confused as to what reduced hours mean if I still earn less than $1000. Is there a huge emphasis on me working less than I did before when I will still earn less than $1000? Because I don't know whether I will be working the same or slightly increased hours.

I just finished my first week back at work, and I can see myself working only 8-16 hours per week due to amount of material I need to study this semester. Does that also mean that I have to give back the $2000 I just received, and switch over CESB?

I asked about how people who applied though CRA could close their claim and the man just said he doesn't think it is possible to do that with service Canada.

Mature Students and CESB eligibility,"I know there is a lot of uncertainty over whether mature students starting school this August/Fall 2020 can apply if they were not students last year and are not students presently. Some of you have applied anyway and some of you haven't. Personally, I have not as I was told by the CRA I was ineligible for the reasons stated above.

Because of this, I sent a letter to Minister Qualtrough asking that CESB be ammended to include mature/gap year students to make it clear, in writing, that we are eligible. I have started a petition to get some documentation of the amount of people left out by the current wording of the benefit. If you are not eligible to CERB and CESB, and had been planning on working this summer to pay for tuition, I encourage you to share your story in the petition comments and explain why CESB would help you.

Petition Link:  [http://chng.it/s7SbGYzp](http://chng.it/s7SbGYzp)

Feel free to share your thoughts

Edit: Changed the link to make it easier to sign the petition

**UPDATE:**  Today (May 25th), the government of Canada updated the CESB eligibility requirements to include wording meant to specify the eligibility of mature and returning students.

*""New post-secondary students with classes starting on or before February 1, 2021, who were not enrolled in high school in 2020, should have documents showing that:*

*their application for admission into a post-secondary program was accepted before the four-week CESB period for which they applied.*

*Furthermore, in future, if requested, they must provide evidence of attending a post-secondary program before February 1, 2021.""*

So make sure you have your documents in order and feel secure knowing that you are eligible for the CESB. I have closed the petition and posted the update there as well

Short-Term Jobs and CESB Eligibility?,"I tried asking in the megathread but it's been quite a while with no responses, I think my comment got buried.... Does anyone know how CESB eligibility works if all you can find is short term contract work? Like if you take a contract that ends before the end of summer because that's all you can get, are you still eligible for CESB after?  


For example, I'm considering applying for a position that's 8 weeks, June/July, $14/hr 30hrs/wk. If this position ran 12 weeks, through August, the pay would be fine. But because it's an 8 week position, I won't earn enough through those 8 weeks to cover even just my rent/tuition going forward even with May's CESB payment. However I don't know that I would still be eligible for CESB afterwards because my job would have ended because that was a short-term contract, not because of COVID. The likelihood of me finding one month's work for August to make up the extra funds I need is essentially zero, particularly considering that I am disabled/can't drive and my pool of suitable work is nearly nonexistent at the best of times (I found all of about 7 jobs to apply for last summer pre-pandemic). If I can't continue to collect CESB afterwards then I wouldn't really call this job suitable since it won't cover even just my two main basic expenses but if I can then it would be pretty great.  


I suspect this will be a hitch with a lot of the Canada Summer Jobs funding in particular. My last job was through CSJ and also only ran 8 weeks mid-summer but I was in less of a financial pinch then so it wasn't a big deal. Unfortunately that seems to be the only kind of work I'm seeing, everything else is either permanent positions and/or doesn't work for me based on qualifications/location/physicality of the work. I've had no luck getting through to CRA to ask, though I'm sure other people will also face this question.

Just got off the phone with Service Canada - I applied for EI-CERB and now CESB is blocked,"**Background:**

I applied for EI-CERB back in April and later realizing that I was not eligible, I have returned the money and stopped doing the reports. Since i have an existing claim with Service Canada, I am unable to apply for CERB.  


**The Call:**

The wait time was short, it estimated 1+ hour but i was able to get in touch with an agent within 10 minutes



They asked me for my SIN number as well as the first 2 digits of my access code, followed by my name. 

At first they asked me why I haven't completed any reports, which I explained how I was not qualified for CESB.

 

They told me I should be qualified for CERB since i made over $5000 last year and is looking for work (?) so I just need to do my reports. I had to clarify that because i was a student in the winter term and didn't ""stop working due to COVID-19"" reasons as I never started work, one of the requirements isn't met. I needed to apply for CESB which i'm certain I qualify for but can't due to EI-CERB blocking it, hence I need to cancel the claim. 



After that, they asked if I have returned the initial amount I received from CERB and I replied yes. I had previously returned it via online banking to CRA's account. They then created a request for escalation for my case to have it resolved, marked the request as urgent, saying I have to give them a call back after 5 business days if the matter isn't resolved then. 


Overall, it was a pleasant experience! 


**If you're in the same boat as me, it looks like they'll be resolving this on an individual basis for the time being , I urge you to contact Service Canada and let them know your situation.**",10,1589999913.0,2020,2020-05-20,CESB Discussion,bssbronzie,6,gnh2xy

Smart stuff to do with your CESB,"Happy Trubuck day! Here’s some things In order based on priority. Considering you paid all basic expenses (rent, food etc)

1) Pay off any high interest debt. Credit cards mainly. You will thank your future self! This doesn’t include student loans since most people have interest free loans that don’t need to be paid until graduation, this is GOOD debt. But if you don’t want to worry about those loans in the future you could pay it off (or a little :P) More info go to r/PersonalFinanceCanada


2) save and make sure you put it into a HISA. A high interest savings account is one that yields in this environment, 1-3%. If you don’t need the money for a longer time consider option 3.

3) INVEST! The stock market is down and if you can manage to find some good companies for the cheap now is a good time or even put it into a lower risk broad market ETF such as VFV.TO which is the 500 best companies in NA or QQC which is the 100 best Tech companies in the Nasdaq. Max out your TFSA, take advantage! Open an account with WealthSimple Trade or even your bank (if you don’t mind fees) Check out r/CanadianInvestor for tips. And r/WallStreetBets for the memes 

4) Treat yourself. Go to that local business, buy a meal, buy that video game you always wanted. You deserve it. 


And if you can, give a little. Wether that be your time or money to a charity. Don’t be selfish. We’re all going through shit right now and we need to be united through this. Pce 🖖",28,1589953731.0,2020,2020-05-20,CESB Discussion,NotLiam19,38,gn5o8u

How do you prove self-employment to CRA for CESB?,"So I applied for CESB, and since one of the requirements is that you must be looking for a job or currently have a job and are making less than $1000 a month, I decided to start applying for some jobs that I'd be interested in. My buddy started his own business a couple of weeks ago which is a vehicle detailing business and offered me a job, which I accepted. However, since he just started up his business, its not registered (which he plans on doing in the next month btw) and I was wondering how I could prove my employment to the CRA if they come auditing me in the future. The job he offered me has a contract, so would that contract be enough proof that I was employed this summer until he registers his business?

How worried should those obviously eligible for CESB be about job searching/documentation?,"I understand there's a lot of specific cases on the fringes and other things that people are worried about, but for those who clearly meet all criteria how worried should we realistically even be about job searching documentation being asked for? From the fraud claim video that got posted here a while ago it seemed like CRA is only concerned with obvious issues their system sees like a fake SIN being used or issues they'll clearly see manually later on like someone making $3k a month that graduated University 5 years ago applying for CESB or whatever. 

For students who genuinely meet all requirements and have no real issues of eligibility is it likely at all that CRA will ask for any documentation from us? Even months or years down the line?

I was really concerned about this documentation aspect and use of words like ""genuine"" and ""everyday"" searching making it seem like if you're not doing it literally every single day possible they'll take the money back, but if there are really this many people who are on the fringes and even those making claims when they shouldn't for CESB (let alone CERB) I don't see a scenario where they'll be requesting months of documentation from students who have no red flags whatsoever with their situation.

Obviously I'll still make the effort to search around and document whatever I can but the vast amount of people who have complicated issues around eligibility seem like the first priority to look into, and that's if they even get through all of those people. I can't imagine a situation where someone who clearly is eligible and has no real issues whatsoever would be looked further into, or am I being naive?",64,1589856174.0,2020,2020-05-18,CESB Question,Pineali,77,gmg31y

The government committed over $9 billion to students (and more for student loan 6mo waiver, some external programs, students who qualified for CERB and some foreign students on CERB etc). We also know that federal student debt averages around $15-19 billion. I know the CESB is an income replacement of course, but student debt still haunts a lot of post-secondary students and graduates. 

Would you have preferred the feds forgave federal student debt just this once instead of the CESB? It would put more money into everyone's pocket, which means more money to spend per month. Or at least something like a cap where you don't pay beyond $10,000 and the rest is forgiven. Your thoughts?

CESB Eligibility Question,"I'm honestly kind of confused about their requirements. So they have the if you are ""unable to work due to COVID19 thing"" then you are eligible.

CRA Audit Process,"I have seen a few questions about what happens if CRA audits you. I thought I would share my experience and others who have been audited can share theirs as well.

I have been audited twice. In my case, both time the audit was about about 3 years after the tax year. 

I received a letter in the mail from CRA saying I was being audited. The letter asked for specific documentation, and gave me 30 days to respond. It included contact information for the person doing the audit. 

The first time I had done my taxes online and the audit request was for all the hard copies related to my tax submission. I had moved a couple times and wasn't sure where all the paperwork was so I called and asked for an extension. I was given an extra 30 days (so 60 days total). On that occasion, I ended up owing money as I had entered an incorrect number and they gave me 30 days to pay it (I could also have negotiated an extension if needed).

The second time my file was flagged because I had submitted that I was a full time student and I was working considerable hours at two jobs. I submitted the documents they requested from my school as well as a word document I typed up explaining my situation. On that occasion, I actually got money back.

On both occasions, the people I spoke to at CRA were extremely helpful and happy to work with me to get the issues resolved. It really wasn't a scary experience and they were very professional. Keep a paper trail of why you felt you were eligible and the efforts you made in good faith to ensure you met the criteria, and you will be fine.

In both cases, I had acted in good faith. It may be a different process if the issues relate to more fraudulent activity vs actions taken in good faith.",23,1589836324.0,2020,2020-05-18,General Discussion,random989898,103,gmackp

Fall 2020 Students (Mature/Gap) - I Was Able To Produce Verification of Enrolment Letter,"So without a doubt, there's a lot of hemming and hawing around whether or not we Mature/Gap Year Fall 2020 students are eligible for CESB. A lot of the confusion stems around what the government will consider as ""enrolled"", whether that's after tuition is paid, or it's after you accept your offer, etc.

Well I am enrolled for this Fall through Saint Lawrence College and I just checked out my portal, and I was able to get a letter of enrollment verification. I am verified enrolled, with the term dates of my courses being stated as well. Therefore, enrollment dates and term dates are DIFFERENT. By all accounts, this should definitively determine that I'm eligible for CESB and it should mean that you are too.

Edit: I forgot to mention, my college is currently NOT accepting spot fees or tuition fees for Fall 2020 at the time this has been posted. So yes, I was able to create this prior to paying for my term.

Edit 2: A lot of comments here seem to think that I posted this as a ""we can show this to the government to prove our eligibility"". My point was that, since there has been so much speculation around what ""enrolled"" means and when we are determined as ""enrolled"", that since a Letter of Enrollment Verification can be produced, we are considered enrolled. Not when we pay tuition, not when we pay a spot fee, but being enrolled and having accepted our offers before the deadline seems to determine enrollment for post-secondary.",56,1589689583.0,2020,2020-05-17,CESB Discussion,DogParksAreForbidden,33,gl963k

It definitely sucks if you desperately need the money. We're Canadians though, and a resilient people. Do not be ashamed to ask for help from your friends and neighbours if you need it.

Unpopular opinion: People should stop complaining about job searching,"CESB was purposefully made to help students during this time because of the lack of jobs this summer due to the pandemic.

I’ve seen many people complain about how daily job searching shouldn’t be requirement, and I can’t understand why it’s such an issue?

The rest of the world is going back to work with businesses slowly opening back up, we should be doing the same instead of fully relying on this credit.

The only argument I’ve seen why this shouldn’t be a requirement is because you feel unsafe working. There’s a ton of jobs that allow
you to work at home or away from people.

EDIT: Just wanted to add on, that this post is more generic.

Yes, I understand the issue of dependants, health conditions, and many more other possible situations that could be affect your ability to work.

A majority of students are below the age of 25 without dependants.",36,1589612935.0,2020,2020-05-16,CESB Discussion,Drip______,0,gkqftv

Info: claiming a disability,"I've seen some conflicting information on here so I thought I'd tell you what I know about claiming the disability amount. This is according to two different CRA agents myself and a friend on the other side of the country spoke to. We asked the same questions and got the same responses from both.

IF YOU APPLY FOR THE LARGER AMOUNT PLEASE HOLD ON TO THE EXTRA $750/mo IN CASE ANY OF THIS INFORMATION IS INCORRECT AND YOU NEED TO PAY IT BACK.

**1. What is the criteria for a disability? Specifically, do I need to submit or have a T2201 form (disability tax credit) filled out?**

*Any permanent or episodic impairment, including a mental impairment, which hinders your full and equal participation in society is considered a disability for the purposes of this benefit. You do NOT need a T2201 form to qualify for the disability amount.*


**2. What proof of my disability do I have to provide if I'm audited? Is a doctor's note sufficient?**

*Right now, they don't know yet. Any proof to bolster your claim would be good. Doctor's note stating that you meet the criteria mentioned above should be good.*

!!!!!! Please pay attention: the note from your doctor MUST describe how your condition prevents you from participating fully and equally in society, and it must also attest that your condition is permanent or episodic.  It is NOT confirmed that you will automatically qualify if you have a disability tax credit. !!!!!!


**3. If I'm later found to not be eligible for the disability amount, what will happen? Do I have to pay back the extra $750/mo or will I have to return everything I received?**

*You do not have to return everything you received. If you are audited and found ineligible for the disability amount but you still qualify for the regular amount, you just have to return the extra $750/mo without interest.* - this was also corroborated by a third party that was consulted by the agent speaking to my friend.


**4. I already submitted my application without realizing I qualify for the disability amount. Can I repay the $1250 that I'm given and then reapply as a person with a disability for the same eligibility period?**

*Yes. It's best to do this online through CRA My Account. It may take a few days for the repayment to go through before you can reapply.*

EDIT: MAY 29 2020 -- NEW INFORMATION: THE REPAYMENT SYSTEM HAS NOT BEEN SET UP AND REPAYMENT/REAPPLICATION FOR THE FIRST PERIOD IS NOT POSSIBLE UNTIL AFTER JUNE 24. [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/cesb/comments/gs6hw6/_/fs8lt3t)



And because I know many of you will be in the same situation that I am: I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder two years ago. I have taken medication for it but never claimed a disability on my taxes or on OSAP. The agent I spoke to said that he had a high degree of confidence that I do qualify for the full CESB disability amount. Ask your doctor if you meet the criteria and if they would be willing to provide a note in the future saying you do (including that it is permanent/episodic and how it negatively impacts your ability to fully participate in society).


Feel free to share your own experiences if you asked similar questions or let us know if you asked anything else I didn't mention here.",98,1589597939.0,2020,2020-05-15,CESB Discussion,smellsliketrouts,49,gknbif

Yes **CRA can ask for follow up documentation if there are any suspicions** we know this already. But this follows up with what she was saying before. 

 *“****Students should not be worried****,” said Qualtrough. “This is an attestation-based process that starts tomorrow, just like the CERB.”* 

*The government will perform checks upon application****,*** *such as flagging duplicate social insurance numbers (SINs) or SINs of those under 15, more thorough verification will occur later on to ensure students receive the benefit as soon as possible...there will be no penalties or interest on repayment of the benefit.* 

 *“We’re not trying to mess with people on this. We really want as many people to get it as possible,” said Qualtrough...“We’re trying to do all we can for Canadian students and that’s right now where our policy direction is.”*",15,1589597074.0,2020,2020-05-15,CESB Discussion,warriorlynx,89,gkn49m

How to keep track of my job searching application?,"There are a lot of questions regarding how will CRA know you've been looking for a job, and they've suggested keeping a spreadsheet and that can be used as proof in the near future.

Read this first so you can put the stress at bay: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/CESB/comments/gkn49m/minister_qualtrough_on_job_requirement/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

My recommendation:

Make an account on  [https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/home](https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/home) and actively use it from time to time.

Keep track of jobs you apply to on this spreadsheet: [Job Search - Canada Service Spread Sheet](https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/apps/EForms/pdf/en/SC-INS5240.pdf)

You do not need to accept any job offers at this time if you believe that it may bring risks to you and your family. You can continue receiving CESB if you remain eligible. Check FAQ for more information.

**IMPORTANT FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:**

**How will CRA know if I drop out in the fall semester? Will I have to pay back the CESB money if I end up dropping out or not attending a post-secondary institute in the upcoming fall semester?**

**Yes**, you are expected to pay back the money since you did not hold up your part of the 'eligible for CESB'.  

The only acceptable proof that we know of as of now if you have attended any semester including the upcoming Fall/Winter will be the T2202 form which we should be able to receive once the term is over/tuition fees are all paid.


If you are graduating from university this summer or graduated in June, you are not required to pay anything back as you fall under still being eligible for CESB.

PSA: HERE’S HOW TO RETURN CERB AND APPLY FOR CESB,"##If you need to return a CERB payment from the CRA

if you applied through the CRA for CERB, you cannot apply for CESB in the same eligibility period.

you need to do one thing:

1. return everything you've received so far through the CRA. minimally you would need to return the $2,000 for the same eligibility period you want to apply for CESB. you can do this online through your myCRA account. after you log in, the option will be available on your homepage under the heading COVID-19 Emergency Support Details with the button Proceed to Pay.

&nbsp;
___ 

## If you need to return a CERB payment from EI

if you applied through EI for CERB, you cannot apply for CESB in the same eligibility period. 

you need to do two things:

1. return everything you’ve received so far through EI. minimally you would need to return the advanced $2,000 you received as soon as your application was approved. if you completed any bi-weekly reports, you need to return $1,000 for every report. you can do this through online banking:
   1. sign in to your financial institution's online banking service
   2. under “Add a Payee"" look for an option such as: CRA (revenue) – tax instalment (to repay the CRA) or Employment and Social Development Canada (to repay service canada)
   3. enter your 9 digit social insurance number (SIN) as the CRA account number
2. close your claim. 
   1. contact service canada to terminate your claim. this will then allow you to apply for CESB for the same eligibility period, as you no longer have an active EI claim in the service canada system. call 1-800-206-7218.
   2. alternatively, stop submitting your bi-weekly reports. once four weeks go by without you submitting a report, your claim will close. this will then allow you to apply for CESB for the same eligibility period, as you no longer have an active EI claim in the service canada system.

PSA: CERB + CERB? YOU CAN ONLY GET 16 WEEKS MAX,"from today’s application for CESB:

## You may apply for COVID-19 support payments for up to 16 weeks total, though the maximum number of weeks may vary if you are a student who has completed high school in 2020.

the application states applicants can only apply to a maximum of 16 weeks for COVID-19 support, which includes both CESB and CERB. given that applicants were eligible for the entire 16 weeks, of course (looking @ u highschoolers lol).

so, any combination of CERB and CESB in different eligibility periods is allowable (i.e. 2 CERB + 2 CESB, 3 CERB + 1 CESB), so long as the applicant doesn’t exceed the total number of weeks allowable.

i guess this means applicants won’t be able to  collect all four periods of CERB and then go on to collect two periods of CESB, after all.

For Sponsored Indigenous Students with Living Allowances,"For indigenous students in Canada;

If you are sponsored by your band/tribe, and you receive a ""living allowance"" of some sort (cash money given to you for food, rent or whatever) this is quick reminder that your sponsored income is exempt from taxes (it is under ""Indian"".) It will not be considered for either CERB or CESB income requirements!! :) 

NOTE: though this is the case for most sponsored students it isn't for everyone, especially non treaty bands, usually your indigenous counselor from your band college will have emailed you. If not please call a CRA agent to confirm if your specific band sponsorship falls under Indian income as it can be tricky. Finally, double check with your counselor, as they're the ones who handle your sponsorship money so they'll know the law around it best.

"Accidentally applied for CERB, am I ineligible for CESB?","Alright so I was just reading the eligibility requirements for CESB and I’m a little worried. So it says that if you applied for CERB you cannot apply for CESB and I kinda messed that up.

So when CERB opened up my parents made me apply for it even though I was pretty sure I wasn’t eligible for it. I had a job last year and I quit it back in the fall so I was pretty sure I wasn’t eligible for CERB because I voluntarily quit my job. So I applied for it, not knowing what I was doing in the first place, and I got the first $2000. But when I fully realized that I wasn’t eligible I didn’t apply for CERB again.

So I’m wondering if this makes me totally ineligible for CESB because I meet every other requirement for it except for the fact that I accidentally applied for CERB. 

Any help on this is really appreciated.

UPDATE: So I paid back the $2000 from CERB and then immediately applied for CESB. Everything worked really smoothly for me and my CESB application seems to have gone through.",27,1589514159.0,2020,2020-05-14,CESB Question,85ultra,0,gk1rss

"Thoughts: Students with dependants have to homeschool their kids right now. We cannot volunteer to work for tuition, as we are ""working"" as teachers (aka gov job). Why can't we get tuition forgiveness, since we are the ones making sure students maintain their educations?","So as a parent (4 kids in school plus 2 toddlers) I have a super busy day being a homeschool teacher from Kindergarten to Grade 4. That is 4 different grades worth of teaching and guidance.

a) I have no time to go look for a job or 'actively' seek employment since I HAVE TO stay home and teach my kids/ take care of them (including the toddlers ... no daycare). This is an impossible requirement for me to fulfill.

b) Canada Student Service Grant: Students are being asked to volunteer to work off their tuition which is great... if you are in a position to do so... Since I am a full-time teacher now, this is also an impossible option to fulfill. 

So here are my thoughts on the matter ... What do you all think?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Dear Government,**

Since I am a full-time teacher now (normally a gov. paid job), should I not qualify as one of the volunteers providing a 'national service' such as full-day education for my kids? 

Since the end of March break, I have been working as a student, teacher, daycare provider, and full-time parent, therefore consuming all working hours of the day

 ""...the government will launch a new national service initiative to recognize students' significant contributions to the COVID-19 efforts"" [Canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/news/2020/04/support-for-students-and-recent-graduates-impacted-by-covid-19.html?dm_i=2AD2,1KSZ2,7HFV9P,5CDGL,1)

To me, providing the necessary education for your children if you are a student with dependents more than qualifies as a ""significant contribution to the COVID-19 efforts"".

I cannot participate in volunteer activities as I am required to stay home and teach my children, therefore I am requesting on behalf of all students with dependents learning at home, to qualify for the Canada Student Service Grant. 

Thank you.

A concerned parent/student.",17,1589506959.0,2020,2020-05-14,CESB Discussion,SteamGirl666,4,gjzzs7

CESB after CERB,"Hi everyone, I was talking to someone from the CESB helpline. I explained them the situation if one is eligible for CESB after they run out of CERB on July 4th (4 months of CERB). Initially he told me that it might not be required as CERB might be extended. Although, he confirmed that one is eligible for CESB benefit for last 2 periods after CERB runs out, you just can't double dip on the same period. 

I also let him know that the information in the canada.ca website can be bit confusing/contradictory and asked him to notify his superiors about the wording.

I have seen someone in the thread who's gotten in call with CESB helpline and advising everyone that they can apply for 16 weeks benefit only, whether it's CERB or CESB. I am not saying you are wrong or I am right, but if I were you, I would be careful. You might be spreading misinformation without knowing when you speak with such confidence.

This is what they told me, we can now wait and see if the information gets updated. Someone else can also call them and confirm if they want to!

Edit: Hi guys, I gave a call again today and this time the lady said that it can only be combined 16 weeks benefit whether it is CESB or CERB. Initially she was suggesting me to switch to CESB but i told her how it makes more sense for me to stay with CERB. The combined 16 weeks benefit is also mentioned when you log in your CRA account. Honestly, the bill just could be more clear about it. Anyway, best of luck to everyone. Please don't double dip and use the aid wisely!",46,1589462951.0,2020,2020-05-14,CESB Discussion,chemasta,22,gjmcl5

Question about grants,"Hey everyone I hope you are all surviving through this, it looks like help could be in sight. 

My question is in regards to the “doubling of grants”. At the end of my 3rd year of university here I had all possible job offers/opportunities stripped away as they were rescinded or canceled all together. Having no practicum options I began applying for mediocre and low skill based jobs. No luck, so with a dwindling savings account I did what many of us have done. Registered for 3 spring/summer courses and qualified for student loans/grants as a full time student. While still applying for full and part time jobs that would work with the online course schedule. 

I received the Grant that the Federal Government gives out to full time students. I have not read anywhere on how they plan to handle this “doubling of grants” will this just automatically be sent to me? Will I have to apply again or is this just some loophole they created where only NEW grants from May 15 onwards will receive the 2x multiplier.

CERB and CESB,"so, right before the new eligibility requirements are listed on the CRA’s site, there’s a big banner that states:

##You cannot apply for the CESB if you already applied for the CERB or EI
**If you have already applied, or are receiving support from the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) or Employment Insurance (EI) you are not eligible to apply for the CESB.**

then the eligibility requirements go on to list:

**Check these boxes to see if you are eligible for the CESB:**

- You did not apply, receive, nor qualify, for the CERB or EI benefits for the same eligibility period

source: https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/benefits/emergency-student-benefit/cesb-who-apply.html
___

so, what do you think? 

does this mean an applicant who qualifies for CERB cannot collect CESB at all in any period? 

what if that applicant qualified but never applied for CERB?

what if that applicant exhausts all 16 weeks of CERB? technically, the applicant isn’t eligible for CERB anymore, so can they collect the remaining periods of CESB? or, if you’ve already applied for CERB you cannot collect CESB at all?

Reporting CESB to OSAP? (Summer Semester Application),"Hi!

So I heard that Queens University is now requiring that the **CESB be reported to OSAP**.

>Updated: May 4, 2020: CERB (Canada Emergency Response Benefit) or CESB (Canada Emergency Student Benefit) income is to be reported on a Full-time OSAP application for the term in which the income is received (i.e., 2020 summer term). 

>For the provincial assessment of Full-time OSAP, **any CERB or CESB received during the study period (i.e., 2020 summer term) will be treated as “other” student study period income (not “government” income) and will be subject to the $5,600 per term income exemption**. [**Source**](https://www.queensu.ca/studentawards/government-student-financial-aid-and-updates)

However my university (and every other university in Ontario according to a quick Google search) has made **no mention of this in their Summer Semester OSAP applications.** This is the question found in all Summer Semester OSAP applications...

>""Do you expect to earn or receive more than $5,600 in income during the summer study period (**not including government income** or scholarships/bursaries/awards)?""

**Should I just answer no?** The CESB will put me over this threshold by ~4K and I'm really not sure how much my OSAP is going to take a hit.

I'm thinking of truthfully answering this question by saying no. If it's necessary, I'll amend my estimated income before the end of my study period if my university tell us that the CESB should be considered regular income rather than ""government income"" as it is appears to be in the application as of right now. 

**Will that be fine or will OSAP hit me with an Overpayment Restriction / Income Variance Restriction even if I later update my income?**

Question about eligibility for a uni student not currently enrolled in courses,"Hi everyone,

I'm wondering if I qualify for CESB. Phone lines are packed, so I'm trying to gain general info about if I qualify or not. 

My situation
- No EI or CERB received 
- Canadian citizen 
- I was sick, so I had to withdraw from my courses in November 2019 
- Since then, I have had a student status at my university. I'm still registered and can use all of their services, but I'm just not in any courses (for spring and summer 2020 semesters, as I was recovering). I'm in a program, which is active. 
- Job search has been abysmal. Monthly income from self-employment is lower than $1000. 

Would I qualify for CESB? I'm wondering about this because I wonder what they mean by 'enrolled in a program'? Does this mean currently taking courses?",2,1589399180.0,2020,2020-05-13,CESB Question,rainfallindelight,4,gj679j

CESB WILL affect OSAP come September!,"**UPDATE!! AFTER CONTACTING MY FINANCIAL AID FOR FURTHER CLARIFICATION THIS WAS THE E-MAIL I RECEIVED.**

"" Hello,

If you will be applying for OSAP again in September you will be submitting a new 2020-2021 application which will be based on your 2019 income tax return and the income your earn during that study period. If you are still receiving the benefit in September and beyond then you would report it if you earn more than $5600 in that term. Your funding assessment will be based on that new income reported on the new application.  

The current income you are earning should be reported on the current OSAP application for Summer 2020 if you are attending and would impact the current funding assessment""

so to clear things up! it will not affect OSAP for September as I was previously lead to believe. it will only affect those who are still attending classes throughout the summer. **sorry for the confusion!!!**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

&#x200B;

just a heads-up I have received a reply from my school, and the CERB and CESB are considered income. they told me there is a $5600 forgiveness, meaning after this amount they will deduct from your OSAP payment.

so for those with disabilities, dependents, or those who have/ will get a job, this will affect your OSAP loan payment come September, should you make more than 5600.

for some this is not an issue as money is dire now, but its something to think about for those who may not need the money or are really relying on that OSAP payments come September!",54,1589397819.0,2020,2020-05-13,CESB Discussion,cassyL91,23,gj5qux

CESB and CERB,"I'm a bit confused. So, today news was released about eligibility for CESB and one of the rules stated ""You did not apply, receive, nor qualify, for the CERB or EI benefits for the same eligibility period."" I noticed that the eligibility periods are May 10 to June 6, 2020, June 7 to July 4, 2020, July 5 to August 1, 2020 and August 2 to August 29, 2020 and the application deadline is September 30. 

I applied for CERB, but my benefits are ending on July 4th. I am also currently enrolled in post-secondary with a start date of August, so could I still apply for CESB after my CERB benefits run out after July 4th? If I were to apply for CESB, would I receive the payments for May and June if I applied after July 4th since it's retroactive for May?

Students starting in September,"My school is going to start in September and I accepted the offer and already paid for commitment fee but not full tuition yet(It will be open in July.). Am I considered enrolled? 

you are enrolled in a post-secondary educational program (at least 12 weeks in duration) that leads to a degree, diploma, or certificate
->I am not sure if I am enrolled.
you completed or ended your post-secondary studies in December 2019 or later
->not me
you completed or expect to complete high school, or received, or expect to receive your high school equivalency in 2020, and have applied for a post-secondary educational program that starts before February 1, 2021
->I graduated high school long time ago

If I don't receive CESB, it's gonna be suck because I am not eligible for CERB.
If may I rant, I had been working until the early March and quit my job voluntarily because my hours kept getting reduced. Right after I quit my job, Sophie(Trudeau's wife)got tested positive for COVID19 and shit went down quickly. I blame my dumbass that I quit my job.

Question about cerb & cesb,"When cerb first came out I had applied figuring what the hell they will deny me if I wasn't eligible. Thing is the applications are automatic so I got the money. Here's  my situation  for applying for cerb and why I applied for cerb : I worked in the last 12 months, I've made $5000 in the last 12 months. I had a job waiting for me once I was finished school but since covid 19 my employer wasn't starting any new projects as of yet.

Now I feel that I may only be eligible for cesb so I didn't reapply for cerb because I'm concerned about owing the government another $2000 and getting in trouble.

So patiently waiting for Cesb I will apply, but I'm wondering if I should be applying to cerb only or should I be applying for cesb and pay the cerb back? Moneys getting low but I will pay the cerb back if I have to. 

Other question about cesb is that I have my daughter on weekends and have been taking her through the week since the pandemic began. Does this make me eligible for the $2000 or should I only be applying for the $1250?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated because I'm at a loss at what I should be doing or applying for!",3,1589390477.0,2020,2020-05-13,CESB Question,koopakid902,0,gj3cd0

Anyone else repaying CERB to apply for CESB?,"tl;dr I applied for CERB, did my taxes and realized I didn't make $5000 like I was sure I did.  But I do qualify for CESB, so I will need to repay $4000 to CERB and apply for CESB. I do have a disability so if I understand things, the amount I would have received from CERB ($8000) is the same as CESB ($8000).

I noticed you can submit the information to pay back CERB online now via the CRA login site. Hopefully I can pay it back online somehow as well, through banking maybe.

Is anyone else in this same situation? Needs to repay CERB and apply for CESB?

Which one should I apply for?,"Long story short, due to COVID-19 the summer job I worked at last summer is not available since the facilities are closed. I'm also a student, which leads credence to  choosing the CESB. However, my contract expired April 30th, and unlike last year I was not given a summer offer since they can't hire anyone with the place closed.

I was thinking about CESB since it's for students, but the job attestation part has me worried since I don't live close to any of those manual labour jobs and I come into contact on a regular basis with people that are at risk. 

If restrictions are lifted and my workplace is open, there's a decent chance I get hired back again, and I don't want to lose this job over some far away job I'd never go back to (not even in my career field).

Is the CESB or CERB a better option for me to choose for the next few months?",11,1589380593.0,2020,2020-05-13,CESB Question,EarthWarping,2,gj08ex

Hoping it's easy to apply for some months and not others,"Some context- I applied for a job that gives 20 hours a week, but since it hasn't started yet, I won't be making more than $1000 for the month of May, and therefore I will qualify for the CESB. However, if my hours stay 20+ hours/week for June, July and August, I won't qualify for the CESB for just those months (since I'll me making just over $1000). This is why I hope I can just get the CESB for the month that I need it, and not automatically receive the money for the entire summer because I'd just have to give it back eventually which is kind of bothersome. I'd rather just be able to apply for only the months I need it. Does anyone have any insight into this?
Edit: If I end up getting this job halfway through May, what would happen to the job bank section of the CESB? I know I have to attest to the fact that I’m looking for work but how does that apply if I am working but making less than $1000 for that month?",1,1589378478.0,2020,2020-05-13,CESB Discussion,VisualCanary7,3,gizlm4

College/university students -- online classes this fall?,"Hi everyone,

I'm an associate producer with CBC Radio's Ottawa Morning -- hope you are all keeping safe. Our show is looking to speak with post-secondary students who are either living back at home with their parents/family in Ottawa or attending (or planning to attend) university/college in Ottawa this fall.

With the news that some post-secondary institutions have made the decision to migrate some classes/programs online for the fall semester, we wanted to gauge what students thought of this decision. This could be anything from choosing to take a year off, to moving towards a reduced course load, to taking on more part-time jobs to pay for school, to advocating for a change to the tuition structure [at your school](https://www.change.org/p/university-of-british-columbia-decrease-the-tuition-of-the-online-education-at-ubc?recruiter=919033661&recruited_by_id=b92b19a0-f67b-11e8-a411-87e7b1cc45c2&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_campaign=petition_dashboard&use_react=false). Or, maybe you're looking forward to all online classes! Whatever the case may be, we want to hear from you. Here's a news article for some background info: [https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/universities-classes-online-covid19-ottawa-queens-1.5565992](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/universities-classes-online-covid19-ottawa-queens-1.5565992)).

Need help,"So I have a couple questions involving applying / qualifying for CESB that I can’t get a straight answer out of Google for. 

1) For applying- I’m 17 years old, and I only started working in the spring of 2019 so I didn’t make enough money last year to file taxes. When I took It to H&R Block to get it filed they said I didn’t have to because I didn’t make much- it would be charging money for nothing. If this is true, and I have no taxes to file, how am I supposed to apply for the CESB? I’m sure I’m not the only one in this type of situation. 

2) As for qualifying, I am enrolled for CarletonU in the Fall 2020 and I fit every qualification for this as I can tell,  but I am still employed. My registered annual income is under the qualification (I make less than $12000 a year) but some people say that they judge based on if you make more than $1000 a month? I’m not sure if I qualify now... some months I’ll make $500 but some really busy months I’ll make just over $1000 which is over the monthly amount. But my annual salary is set under the yearly limit of $12000 per year. So will I qualify or not??",4,1589304370.0,2020,2020-05-12,,JCadoo,0,gifr1w

Spoke with an agent about repaying CERB and applying for CESB,"I have been receiving CERB through EI and I realized I do not qualify for EI or CERB. I do not have the insurance hours for EI and I didn’t make more than $5000 last year.

I spoke with a cra agent this morning about repaying the money and applying for cesb. She told me that if I didn’t qualify for ei but applied for cerb through ei, then they would just stop my ei payments after cerb ran out. Since I qualify for neither, she said to pay back the money through the online payment option, and apply for cesb when it becomes available.

I asked if I would be blocked from applying for cesb since I have an open ei claim. She said she did not know but is escalating my call to an agent who can help me. I will update when I hear back.

TL;DR

Agents don’t know much more than we do at this point. If you don’t qualify for ei or cerb, just pay back the money through the online payment option and try applying for cesb when it becomes available",9,1589300009.0,2020,2020-05-12,,pblack177,1,gie97u

I don't even know if I'm elligible for CESB and my mother made me apply for CERB.,"I have 3 questions.

So, let's start by saying that my mother kept insisting that the CESB was out and that students could submit a demand on it. Long story short, she got both my sisters to submit a demand on the website, thinking it was the CESB. Turns out, she was f\*cking wrong (as I had told her but she wouldn't listen). So my question is, how the heck do we get off this?  I'm pretty darn lost and I don't want to screw things up.

Second, I don't know if I'm elligible for CESB. I'm a university student, and I was, like I did last summer, going to work at a tree nursery (I was officially hired again at the beginning of March, before all this fiasco).  Last year I worked there from end of April to mid-august. This year, it was already planned that I wouldn't be able to work as much because of a summer semester (Semester starting in May and ending at the end of June). I was planning to work from end of June to mid-August (that's the best I could do, as I can't work during my semester with this particular job). But then COVID happened, and that delayed everything. Now my summer semester is from May to end of July. Since I can't work during my semester, that logically leaves me 2 weeks of work for the two first weeks of august (There are personal reasons as to why I don't work the last two weeks of august). I think it's safe to say I probably won't be called to work, even though I was scheduled to work there this year. My guess is 1) The company won't open any time soon, or 2) They're open but they just work with less employees and decided to let work the people who are seasonal employees and not students. Does that make me elligible?

Third question is similar to second one, except it's related to my sisters. They were, like me, scheduled to work at the tree nursery. They're in CEGEP, so they were set to start work at the end of May until mid-August. As I said earlier, company starts around April 27th. We're now April 12th and we've not received any call. Does that make them elligible too?

Thanks in advance to whoever answers this.

"Currently in school for summer, need some advice/ help about the CESB","Hi, let me start by saying I have read the FAQ, and although it partly answered my questions I am still confused and uncertain about if I should apply for CESB.

Starting in 2 weeks I will begin my second semester of college. this semester goes till the end of Aug. and then starting in September I will start my second year ( its a fast track program). I will be receiving my second payment from OSAP in the next few weeks as well. I have 2 children so I qualify for the 2k from CESB.

My questions are, does someone who is taking classes, full time, throughout the summer, as well as receiving OSAP at this time ( which is well above the 1000 dollar max the government is saying you can make) qualify for the CESB?

Also, will this affect my OSAP come Sept? I know the government is saying OSAP does not count as income. but will OSAP consider these benefits as income and offer me less in funding?

Because to be honest the amount of funding I would receive from OSAP come sept heavily outweighs the CESB payments I would get for a few months. 

I am just unsure if it will be worth it, in the long run, to collect CESB if it will affect my OSAP come sept.",12,1589251067.0,2020,2020-05-11,,cassyL91,8,gi2cqg

Any guarantee that earning employment income (less than $1000/month) won't hurt eligibility?,"There has been talk since the beginning that students who earn employment income under $1000/month would be eligible for the CESB. I was wondering if there is any legal basis for this. I reviewed the *Canada Emergency Student Benefit Act* and it still seems unclear (apologies for the legalese):

***Eligibility***

***6*** ***(1)*** *A student is eligible for a Canada emergency student benefit if*  
***(a)*** *for reasons related to the coronavirus disease 2019 and whether as an employee or in self-employment, they are unable to work, are seeking work and unable to find it, or are working but are paid less than the amount determined under the regulations, during the four-week period for which they apply for the benefit; and*   
***(b)*** *they do not, in respect of any part of that four-week period, receive*  
***(i)*** *subject to the regulations, income from employment or self-employment,*  
***(ii)*** *benefits, as defined in subsection 2(1) of the Employment Insurance Act, or an employment insurance emergency response benefit referred to in section 153.‍7 of that Act,*  
***(iii)*** *allowances, money or other benefits that would be paid to the student under a provincial plan because of pregnancy or in respect of the care by the student of one or more of their new-born children or one or more children placed with them for the purpose of adoption,*  
***(iv)*** *an income support payment under the Canada Emergency Response Benefit Act, or*  
***(v)*** *any other income that is prescribed by regulation.*

***Regulations***

***(2)*** *With the consent of the Minister of Finance, the Minister may make regulations*  
***(a)*** *respecting the meaning of terms referred to in paragraph (1)‍(a) and the amount referred to in that paragraph;*  
***(b)*** *excluding income from the application of subparagraph (1)‍(b)‍(i); and*  
***(c)*** *prescribing any other income for the purposes of subparagraph (1)‍(b)‍(v).*

**To provide a very basic translation, it appears that 6(1)(b)(i) indicates that earning employment or self-employment income would make you ineligible. HOWEVER, 6(2)(b) provides that the Minister of Finance may make a regulation dispensing with that requirement. As far as I know, no such regulation has been made (yet).**

This makes me nervous, because it seems like the ""less than 1000/month"" exemption is currently just a promise without legal grounding. As someone who is making slightly less than $1000/month, I would be gutted to suddenly become ineligible, as I was counting on the CESB to help pay my bills. Thoughts? 

TL;DR: Is there any assurance/legal basis behind the assertion that those making less than $1000/month in employment/self-employment income would remain eligible for the CESB?",6,1589224219.0,2020,2020-05-11,,lumi-bun,14,ghu76k

How do we prove a disability,"Since the application will be through cra and not student loan portals how will be prove disability status? I am thinking since it may rely in having a disability tax certificate with the cra that could leave a lot of students out since the definition of disabled is different for the cra than it is for student loans. Cra doesn't include things like learning disabilities and cognition issues etc whereas the student loan definitions do.

A lot of students have disability status with student loans but not with the cra. 

If it goes by the cra definition that means a lot of students with a disability status with student loans and the school but not with cra will be sol for the additional funds.

The question is what definition will they use and what proof will they ask for? If they are going to be asking for proof will that significantly delay processing?

Students with school-aged dependants means you are now a homeschool teacher AND a student. I don't have time to apply for jobs (let alone hold one) and teach school to 4 kids! What are we supposed to do???,"I barely had any sanity by the end of finals having homeschooled 4 kids since the end of March Break.

If students have school-aged dependants and are currently forced to homeschool our kids, how are we to be expected to actively seek employment (when we are supposed to be staying home as much as possible?? I don't get it...) AND take care of our kid's schooling AND take care of all the regular household needs in a day... 

I have seen nothing regarding students with dependents other than the difference in funding...

On top of this one of my kids has asthma, and I have 2 toddlers at home... (total kids = 6)

I would normally be working from home in my field (graphic design/marketing) in the summer, by that field is seriously low traffic right now with no businesses open and certainly not wanting to spend MORE money on print media and graphics when they are barely staying afloat. So in short, yes, my industry is affected. 

I know I am not the only one in this boat that has absolutely 0% extra time between all my kids being home and making more messes, needing more care and attention (aka breaking up sibling battles), and homeschooling them to go look for work/ go to interviews, nor do I care to risk my family's health.

I'd love to hear thoughts and opinions on this demographic of students with dependents",4,1589157099.0,2020,2020-05-10,,SteamGirl666,1,ghd6d4

"Enrolled in program in December 2019, but no classes?","As the title says, according to my T2202A form, I have technically been “enrolled” in a program through December 2019. Problem is, I didn’t take courses in the fall, but I took courses in winter 2020.

How would the CRA assess this? It doesn’t really state that you have to be enrolled in courses, but I’m not sure.


“current post-secondary students who were enrolled in a degree, diploma, or certificate program at any time, between December 1, 2019 and August 2020”

Experience with EI - Potential Insight.,"Hi!

I’ve seen a lot of people ask questions about eligibility for CESB and other potentialities.

Let me preface this by saying this was just my experience with EI, everyone will have different experiences with government programs. In short, no one really knows anything except little crumbs of information let out, try to not stress and be patient, all relevant information will be present in the application. Please don’t argue or be judgmental on my post, as mentioned I’m just discussing my experience. Other people maybe had better experiences on EI. Not trying to deter people either, just be smart when figuring out whether to apply and how to manage money when it is in your hands, mismanagement can have detrimental consequences. I would think most people don’t want to be harassed by the CRA.

Currently I’m a university student, my degree is through an accredited Ontario university that offers online degrees! (Huge money saver btw - tuition and associated fees are drastically cheaper).

In 2018 I worked for a Cadillac Fairview mall and developed PTSD. CF has a Disability Management program through Mourneau-Shepell. I was denied, so I decided to go on EI. I also had to go to ServiceCanada office on 5 occasions with Doctor’s notes (clearly not happening at this time). EI system has been “broken” for like 50 years and the computer system they use is like 46 years old or something (so I heard - can’t verify).

All was well on EI until the day they audited me. I did do everything 100% correctly, reporting and such. One thing I will say is that EI never really “asked” if I was looking for work while on the Sickness Benefits. There was a box to check off saying “Are you looking for work?”, beyond that there was no concrete way to tell if I was really looking. Anyways, back to the audit. EI paid me out more than they should’ve. I was sent to their Investigations Department. The person on the other end told me it “wasn’t truly my fault, just the way timing worked out.” I was penalized $1000 and they immediately took that off my tax return. I also appealed that, because they clearly stated the onus wasn’t on me. It was “just the way timing worked out.” I lost the appeal and you’re allowed one appeal by law. 

As other posters mentioned, use your money however you desire, but be cautious and realistic. Though it’ll be a logistical nightmare, the time can and will likely occur one day where your information is audited. Realistically speaking, the government needs to recoup that money somehow.

All the best fellow students!",4,1589143235.0,2020,2020-05-10,,,7,gh94dg

Eligibility CERB vs CESB,"I have a quick question about using both CERB and CESB. 

I've been on CERB for the past 2 eligibility periods (March and April). I was fully eligible for those periods as I lost all my income due to COVID reasons. 

My question is moving forward, should I not apply for CESB instead? My understanding is that there is a 16 week maximum for CERB which I'm half way through. Whereas, I could earn the full $5000 CESB benefit over the next 4 months (vs $4000 CERB over 2 months). 

In terms of eligibility, I recently graduated in April 2020 and am currently actively looking for employment.

Financial Tips for students on the CESB,"You can take the advice or not, up to you. I'm just trying to help out students because I know what it was like. I know everyone's situation is different and for many they won't be able to save a dime. I recommend r/PersonalFinanceCanada if you haven't subbed yet for personal finance advice.

**1. Try to save as much as you can**. Perhaps it's not a good time to buy that new gaming rig or console and you can try to eat-in more often. CESB is set to ***expire*** as a benefit on September 30th, no one will be able to get it after that. If we have a second wave and a lockdown again in the Fall, ***students are going to be an afterthought.***

**2. Use it for Tuition/supplies** for the fall and take advantage of double CSG if you receive it. If you don't take out student loans, you can try to see if you qualify for the grant however little it may be. In Ontario, you have an option of taking grants only, so you don't have to take out a loan in Ontario.

**3. If you have credit card debt**, pay it off first even if you have student loans since you have options like RAP. Credit cards have very high-interest rates that range from 19-24%. 

**4. Help pay off some of your student loans.** Since payments and interest are currently on hold till September 30th, the summer could be a good way to try to pay into principal (all depends on your situation). We have been told you're allowed to do pay into it (if you want, you could put it in a 90-day guaranteed investment and then pay into it in the fall). 

**5. You can invest if you know what you're doing.** There are guaranteed investment options to be on the safe side.

**6. If you think you will be making over the federal/ provincial exemptions**, you can use a calculator (this is for 2019) like [https://turbotax.intuit.ca/tax-resources/canada-income-tax-calculator.jsp](https://turbotax.intuit.ca/tax-resources/canada-income-tax-calculator.jsp) to see how much tax you would owe or what refund you can expect. This way you can try to keep some of your CESB money aside for taxes if need be.

"(Rant) I'll go to work, but I am not pleased about the risk I'm being forced to take on behalf of my family","Quit my job in early December. It was a toxic environment and they worked me like a dog. I was passed over for raises in favor of people I personally trained. Many scummy things were done to me that I willingly took in stride because I thought it would further me in that company. You ever filter a deep fryer when the oil was still 300 degrees with nothing but a large pot and two flimsy rags?

Anyway, I used that time to destress in preparation for college in January. I was perfectly comfortable with living off of my savings until March, when ideally I would have reinvested myself into the job market.

March comes around, what comes next is the same old story. Country closes down, and CERB is created for the people who lost their jobs. I was one of the people who fell through the cracks. I qualified on everything other than the fact that I quit my job voluntarily.

It felt unfair and still does feel a little unfair but I could understand their reasoning. I don't need to be handed anything in life. I chose to quit my job to pursue school. If I was that desperate for money, I could have taken it upon myself to find a job. I strongly considered it at the time, the only thing that held me back was the fact that I live with my immunocompromised father and sister. If anything were to happen to them, it would have been my fault and I wouldn't have been able to forgive myself.

Imagine my delight when CESB was announced. Finally, CERB's potholes would finally be filled. It looks like I qualify.... but I'd need to prove I'm looking for work.

Again, I'm not entitled to anything. However I feel insulted that in order to get money I could really use and already paid into with my taxes, I'd have to make a gamble on my loved ones' wellbeing. I thought that given how liberal they were with CERB, the same understanding would be afforded to students. But what the fuck? I know highschool students who worked in cinemas who **never paid taxes in their lives**, didn't even scratch 1k/month in revenue while employed yet now they're sitting at home with 2k in the bank every month, most of which they'll get to keep come next tax season. And I'm expected to put other people's lives on the line if I want to get less than they do, for a shorter period of time?

I'm fine with working. Don't dismiss me as a lazy mooch. I want to work. Working long shifts would be easier than ever because school is almost literally at my fingertips at the moment. But the notion that I'd be indirectly responsible for hospitalizing a loved one is yet again going to keep me from capitalizing on money I really do need. Money I'd have to return most of to the government.

My savings weren't intended to stretch out this long, yet I'm still making due. I thought this would provide me with some peace of mind but if anything it made everything more stressful. Either I apply for CESB and get a job, get sick and bring it home to the people who would actually suffer from it, or I stay in isolation and spend money I can't really afford to spend to pay for my bills, food, gas, etc.

The worst part is that some people on this subreddit seem to have it worse than I do. Working would interfere with their academic career, some of them have dependants, etc. and they're all being forced back into the job market, meanwhile some of us are still at home, kicking their feet back and enjoying the good life. And if you dare complain, they call you a lazy mooch. The amount of times I've heard ***""oh just get a job in a grocery store/farm/gas station! CERB is for people who LOST their job not QUIT it, dickhead! lolololololz look at my moneybags!""*** from people (namely the more carefree CERBites/EI dorks) unwilling to understand my situation is too high. The previous quote is clearly exaggeration but it's not too far off from what most people tell me. And now the government is partaking in the same lack of understanding? Fuck if I kept busting my ass at that piece of shit job or got a new one on time everything would be much simpler. I'd be one of the people who could kick my feet up with my $2k guaranteed to come in every month, without any worry that I'd have to look for a job.

What the fuck were they thinking? Why are students getting singled out?

I'm probably gonna apply, but I do so reluctantly. There's a high chance I might just cave in to fear and forget the entire prospect.",12,1589063828.0,2020,2020-05-09,,,17,ggpbys

Practicum student unable to work can I apply for CESB,"I'm a current practicum student and have been since last August. I've been unable to work since I basically ""work"" 35 hours a week attending practicum.  I also have been studying for a license exam the past month and the next month as I  have to write it in June or July. So due to these circumstances, Ive been unable to work. 

I've been reading the requirements for the Cesb and it says you have to have been applying for  jobs to be eligible. Will I  still be able to qualify even though I have been unable to look for work due to being in a practicum even though  I ana student??

It's incredibly frustrating that CESB doesn't account for this and clarify/specify.

**STATUS OF OFFICIAL CRA INFO ON CESB:**  [https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/benefits/emergency-student-benefit.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/benefits/emergency-student-benefit.html)

I will be updating this thread as the days (or hours) goes by....

# MAY 13TH UPDATES

**UPDATE:** Minister Qualtrough on Power & Politics says the government won't charge interest or penalize you taking out the CESB/CERB if you didn't qualify for it. You will just have to return it back.

**UPDATE:** More official details on the CESB [https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/news/2020/05/backgrounder-the-canada-emergency-student-benefit.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/news/2020/05/backgrounder-the-canada-emergency-student-benefit.html)

Example of details: The $1,000 limit does not include: pensions, student grants and loans, scholarships, bursaries, graduate stipends family, common-law, and spousal income graduate stipends and bursaries educational funding for indigenous students through the Post-Secondary Student Support Program (PSSSP)

**UPDATE:** Official press release [https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/news/2020/05/canada-emergency-student-benefit-application-period-to-launch-on-may-15-2020.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/news/2020/05/canada-emergency-student-benefit-application-period-to-launch-on-may-15-2020.html)

**NOTE:** For those with situations where they can't work in the summer one of the categories is ""you are unable to work due to COVID-19"". So if you can't work you don't have to meet the job bank requirement if I understand correctly. For example some have kids who are staying at home and not going to school so how can you work, what's odd is there is no explanation of ""unable to work"" and I'm going by assumption here. If anyone can find an explanation please let me know there are people really concerned about it.

**UPDATE:** Regarding **Looking for jobs and the Job Bank**: (If you are able to work) The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) may ask you to provide information later to verify that you have been looking for work during the eligibility period(s) that you have applied for, **so it is important to keep track of your daily job search activities.**

**Registering with the Government of Canada Job Bank is an easy way for you to show that you are looking for work.** ( [https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/findajob/resources/cesb](https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/findajob/resources/cesb) )Once registered, the Job Bank will notify you of current jobs available in your field and location, as well as jobs available in essential sectors. You can also use the Job Bank to find tips to help you update your resume and explore career options. By using the Job Bank, you can keep track of your job search activities in one place.

**UPDATE:** For **High Schoolers**: If you finished high school before May 10th, you can be eligible for FOUR periods (as long as you still qualify). If you finished high school before June 7th you can qualify for THREE periods. If you graduated AFTER June 7th, you can only qualify for TWO periods.

**UPDATE:** The **4 week periods** are: May 10 to June 6, 2020, June 7 to July 4, 2020, July 5 to August 1, 2020, August 2 to August 29, 2020. You can't apply for all of them at once.

**UPDATE:** For students with **Disabilities**:  ""Any impairment, including a physical, mental, intellectual, cognitive, learning, communication or sensory impairment — or a functional limitation — whether permanent or episodic in nature, or evident or not, that, in interaction with a barrier, hinders a person’s full and equal participation in society. ""

**UPDATE:** For all those students **going to school in Sept-Jan**: ""you completed or expect to complete high school, or received, or expect to receive your high school equivalency in 2020, and have applied for a post-secondary educational program that starts before February 1, 2021""

**UPDATE:** Website has gone live!  [https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/benefits/emergency-student-benefit.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/benefits/emergency-student-benefit.html)

**UPDATE:** Minister Qualtrough also confirms that it's this Friday. More:

\- **We are NOT GOING TO FORCE students to get a job, they have to just attest that they aren't refusing but actively looking**\- Students who are in **high school can ONLY apply for July and August**\- Application will still be based on Birth Month (we know Fri/Sat/Sun is for everyone)- Direct deposit from 3-5 business days.- **CESB Website will be live today**.- Confirms $1250 for students or $2000 for students with dependents and disabilities.- Just like the CERB, the cut off is $1000 in earnings in a 4 week period.- Says that as situation evolves CERB and CESB could have a clawback system in earnings (for those who earn more than $1000), but not yet and the Act has flexibility in doing something like this.- Students will be directed to a Canada job bank and the Quebec job bank (if in Quebec).

**UPDATE:** Vassy of the CBC says the gov't has informed her that the CESB INFO site will go live today.

**NOTE:** Now that we know it's **Friday**, there is no Birth Month requirement to apply so all students who are eligible can apply. Make sure you register for your CRA account or call 1-800-959-8281 to activate your SIN if you have never filed for your taxes. There are NO other methods right now please do not respond to text messages or emails which are scams.

**UPDATE:** The PM talks about the CESB and is **confirming that the application is out on Friday.**

**UPDATE:** [CTVNews.ca](https://CTVNews.ca) says the PM will have more to say about students this morning. Credit goes to u/nanodime

# MAY 12TH UPDATES

**UPDATE:** “CTV News Vancouver reached out to the Canada Revenue Agency, which will deliver the benefit, and we were referred to Employment and Social Development Canada for answers to our questions (like when the application is out).

**UPDATE:** Vassy of the CBC says that the government has **not responded** to her request if the application for CESB is still on for (prior to or on) May 15th.

**UPDATE:** Trudeau this morning recognizes students won't have a summer job and would be unable to pay their tuition next year, says ""we will be there for everyone"". Mentioned students again that they needed ""immediate help"" since May. No mention of CESB directly or no one in the media is asking about it.

**UPDATE:** CRA has an Alpha version of ""Find financial help during COVID-19"". I found student loan info and grants so it does confirm about double grants for disabilities for example on top of CSG. Might want to try a few things to see if CESB comes up if you can maybe soon.  [https://covid-benefits.alpha.canada.ca/en/start](https://covid-benefits.alpha.canada.ca/en/start)

**NOTE:** CRA system update is specifically for CERB third period applications, no sign of CESB yet

# MAY 10TH UPDATES

**UPDATE:** Universities like Queens are now saying to report CESB as ""other student study period income"" on your OSAP (student loans in Ontario) even for the Summer term. There is a $5,600 per term income exemption (since most students are to make $1250/mo it shouldn't be an issue).

**UPDATE:** Class A Reservists who receive Class A pay may not be eligible for the CESB, if you want to access the CESB because of Covid-19 you will have to notify your chain of command .

**UPDATE:** Transcript is available for the Senate Hearings on the CESB. It gives some clarity on the CESB, but as mentioned in the FAQ it's likely that the Liberals told Senators what they wanted to hear. [https://sencanada.ca/en/content/sen/chamber/431/debates/020db\_2020-05-01-e?language=e](https://sencanada.ca/en/content/sen/chamber/431/debates/020db_2020-05-01-e?language=e)

From Minister Qualtrough during the Senate hearings on May 1st:

*- Students must pursue any job opportunities and if they don't look for work or accept a job they're not eligible. (Note: We don't know if there are exemptions, it could be similar to EI's suitable work requirements and exemptions that exist:* [https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/suitable-employment.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/suitable-employment.html) )

*- You must attest that you are not receiving the CERB*

*- Within hours you can get direct deposit, within days they'll get their cheque.*

*- ""The Job Bank we have for the federal government is quite robust. Employers regularly post opportunities. We drive students to those opportunities in a variety of ways. We have social media campaigns to tell students to go here for these jobs available in your region.""*

Given that this is a student benefit, I would like to think that as I qualify as a disabled student through NSLSC and my school, I’d qualify as disabled through CESB but there is nothing I’ve found to say whether or not this is accurate.

High School Students CESB Questions,"I don't see any high school students graduating before June. Therefore, they wouldn't be eligible until they graduate? making them only eligible for the July-August benefit?  Can anyone clarify this information? is it: **(a)** or **(b)** or **(c)** or do they mean **(a)** and **(b)** and **(c)**

If it is (a) or (b) or (c) high school students would still be eligible under (a) since they enrol for post-secondary studies prior to August. 

Is there any way for high school students to reap the entire benefit? 

I have seen many high school students being employed in essential services lately. Most have cut their hours to 12/week in order to be able to have the full benefit. I told most to not cut their hours since they would only be eligible for 2 months. However, most believe it is a rumour and that they will be able to benefit for the entire 4 months. I wanted to clarify this information with other opinions. 

Would High School students have to fill both **(a)** and **(b)** or **(c)**? 

What if they meet criteria (a) and (c), are they eligible? 

What if they do not meet the requirements for (b) since they haven't graduated yet, but meet the requirements for (c). Does it make them eligible for the full benefit?

CESB/CERB eligibility,"Worth a shot to see if anyone can help me out with this weird situation I’m in.

Before CESB was ever announced, I had two jobs for the longest time, one being with a restaurant and one being a FSWEP contract till the end of April. My job with the restaurant would qualify me for CERB since they closed due to COVID but I was still working for FSWEP till my contract ended so I didn’t apply for CERB. 

My friend’s job at the retirement home needed extra help so I came on as a temporary worker till I had classes again in the beginning of May. Unfortunately, I think because I had to tell the retirement home I needed to leave for school, it would be considered as me “quitting” rather than being laid off or considered as a contract worker. 

I’m not sure if I qualify for CERB since one of my jobs (the restaurant one) qualifies me as laid off while the temporary job at the retirement home might not qualify me. 

Since I’m going back to school then I know CESB will qualify me but who knows when that’ll be open.",0,1588874867.0,2020,2020-05-07,,Si11yrabbitTrixR4Kid,0,gfbsj7

Should I apply for CESB before or after returning my EI/CERB,"So let me say I started by wrongly applying for Cerb after being laid off. I understand I have to return the $2000 from that.

Then, I started getting EI as I was laid off from my part time job. I felt ... uneasy about it because I hadn’t been working at my job long (4-5 months). I thought “well, EI approved me so it must be right, and CERB automatically approves people but EI takes time”. Wrong. Ei which turned into cerb was automatically approving people too.

Based on the math, I do not have the hours needed for EI. I have about 400 and I need 700 for my area (Toronto). SO, I have been incorrectly receiving EIERB and the CERB which means I have to pay back thousands of dollars. Cool, I get that, and I will do tbat May 11th when I can do it online.

I also didn’t make $5000 last year so I don’t qualify for cerb or ei 

Now, I DO qualify for CESB. I was/am still a full time student. My summer internship, the last part of my school requirement, was cancelled. I can’t find a job, I was laid off from my part time job.

Filing taxes for the first time! (Help to apply for CESB),"Hey so I’ve seen a lot of people posting that either they never had a job or didn’t work last year so you hadn’t filed taxes. Hopefully this post helps you out! 

Okay so file your taxes as ZERO income. I recommend Netfile or if that doesn’t work then you will have to file your taxes by paper (or use whatever program your parents use). So when you are filing your taxes it will ask you if you want to Register for a CRA account and absolutely say yes to that. Then you are set to go! Usually it takes 3-4 weeks to get a reply but it might take less time since it’ll be 0 income. 

To know when you can register for CRA account:
They will send you a email saying “direct deposit updated,” or “ marital status updated”. That’s when you can get go registered! Enter in the info and you will gain access to a limited account but don’t worry you will probably be able to apply for CESB still even with limited access. (On your CRA account it’ll show you that you can apply for CERB so I assume you can still apply for CESB once it comes out) all done! To gain full access wait 10 days to get a code by the mail and you should be good! 

I’m no expert but I will answer questions if you have any that I can answer. 
Hope this helps!! 💚",9,1588819791.0,2020,2020-05-06,,FantasticRosa,10,geyfml

CERB for student laid off from internship in April,"Hi there, I just had a quick question regarding whether I qualify for CERB or not. I started an internship in January which was due to end on May 1st. However, I got laid off 3 weeks earlier, so about April 10th.

In terms of meeting the criteria, I tick all the boxes as I'd earned beyond the cutoff amount way before the internship was due to end. I have already applied for CERB but I'm not touching the money as yet in case I do have to pay it back.

Also, another question I have is that my contract stated that it would end on May 1st for sure. Following that logic, I'd be knowingly unemployed after that date and have only applied for one CERB payment to cover the 3 weeks pay that I'd lose out on. While technically I could apply for three more payments, it's probably not advisable (or the right thing) to do for whenever the CRA starts to be a bit more strict about who got paid, right?

BTW, I posted this on r/EICERB [too](https://www.reddit.com/r/EICERB/comments/ge67ni/cerb_for_student_laid_off_from_internship_in_april/) and got an answer which I'm good with, but thought it might be useful to post here too.",3,1588800104.0,2020,2020-05-06,,PureCamel,0,gesvxw

What to do if you do not have a CRA Account,"I thought this would be helpful to those with the following:

* **\*\*You are eligible and want to apply for CERB or CESB\*\***
* You do not have a CRA Account
* You haven't filed taxes for 2019 or previous years
* You have filed your taxes this year but are waiting for your NOA (Notice of Assessment) and access to your CRA Account

You must call CRA's number for CERB or their general line and tell them that you do not have a CRA Account but would like to update your **SIN, address, bank information, and other CRA details** to apply for CERB/CESB.

This way you are able to apply for the benefits you are able to obtain without a CRA Account. *Assuming that CESB will have an automated line to apply, you will be able to receive your CESB through direct deposit.*

You will be on hold for a long time, expect 1 Hour or more wait times. I'm 21, and just filed taxes in early April and then I had to apply for CERB afterwards however since my NOA won't be available for a long time I called CRA and the rep was very helpful

***\*\* If you try to call CRA's automated lined and tap in your SIN to apply for CERB/CESB, you will be denied access if you do not have a CRA Account or information in the system \*\****",9,1588791056.0,2020,2020-05-06,,zjuy,20,gepz59

What am I eligible for?,"Hey everyone! First time posting here, hoping I can find some answers to my questions.
I'll post it both here and on the EICERB subreddit.

It's actually quite simple: I'd like to know what I'm currently eligible for money wise with all the financial help (federal and/or provincial) that we see going around. I actually can't follow anymore.

I'm a collegial student in Quebec, and I currently make around 1400-1500$ a month (increased my hours due to distance courses); I've been living with my girlfriend for a couple years, and she is currently benefiting from the CERB as a dental assistant who can't currently work. I know that a few weeks ago, the prime minister announced future plans for students winning under 1000$ a month, and workers winning under 2500$ a month - I then never about it again. I see now that the bill for students earning under 1k$ has passed, which would let me earn an additional 1250$ if I was to lower my hours to earn only 1k$ a month. All I see for those under 2500$ right now in my location though is what has been offered by Quebec: a bonus 400$ for working - which would put me at 1800, much lower than the 2250 I'd make if I was to lower my hours. 

Is there actually something up for my situation, and if so, where do I sign up for said help. Otherwise, should I actually work with my employer to lower my hours per month to be eligible to the CESB, and if so, should I do it Now to earn more money at the end, or should I wait for the inscription date, which seems to be May 19th (Not true, this is the date for the Quebec 400$, what is the actual application date for the CESB, if there is one already?)?

Thanks for the help!",8,1588674630.0,2020,2020-05-05,,Elmorick,0,gdvc1o

The problem with CESB,"Downvote away.

I think this reddit is seriously overlooking the issues this benefit has inherently. And while the conservatives maybe blocking it, it doesn't change the flaw in CESB.

So let's get what the conservatives want out the way, they're hypothetically not affecting the bill, I'm just discussing the original purposed bill. Because most of this reddit's issue is what cons are doing.

I think the issue with cons approach is that they're using and delaying the benefit to accomplish something they want. Similarly, Democrats are doing this in the US. While the essential workforce shortage is an issue, the benefit shouldn't be utilized to fix that problem. The entire discussion about CESB in parliament should be the best way to help students affected by COVID-19. Anyways, the conservative do have correct criticism as it incentivizes students to not work or not pursue more work. 

The issue is that CESB is flawed in which students who weren't working, completely unaffected by covid-19 (idk what percentage this is, but I assume a lot), would make more or the same doing nothing than actual working students. And whether the conservatives are complaining or not this is still an issue.

Think about this scenerio. I'm going to use 14/hr in this example. If I was a student with no job going into May, what should I do? Start a new job at 14/hr or earn 1250 a month? I'm going to choose 1250 everytime. Why would I hustle working when I could just get a paycheck and spend my time doing other things? There's no incentive unless I really want more money.

If I wanted too, I could earn more by working 17 hours a week to earn $1000. On a farm. Now I'm earning $2250. 

Now in contrast, working more than 17 hours per week I would disqualify my CESB eligibility. To earn the equivalent of $2250 just by working without CESB, I'd have to work 40 hours a week. With that in mind, in a general sense, why would students work 40 hours a week vs 17 hours a week? What's the point of working 20 hours? There's no incentive for deciding to work more than 17 hours a week at minimum wage even excluding the fact that your time can be optimized doing other things. People are being rewarded for not working while other who are working more are being left out. That's the issue with the proposed bill.

Now the arguement, I've mostly seen against this are jobs available can lead to health concerns and people on CERB don't have this issue. This is true. However, this is an benefit alloted to people who lost their jobs and CERB is running along EI. Meaning those with jobs and were paying EI on there paychecks. Student that weren't working during the school year don't get employment insurance. I do think students who lost already accepted positions due to COVID-19 shouldn't have been left out of CERB to begin with. But for other students, that were planning to get a job, planning to get a job and not getting one is a lot different than losing a job. 

Under normal circumstances, students shouldn't just expect to find a job when they become available to work. I understand reasons why students made the choice to not work during the school year, but there are risks to that choice. People with jobs that were lost already paid for EI. So in a way, they are entitled to CERB. Even this notorious 15 year old.

Students without jobs have not contributed to the economy/workforce outside of paying tuition, but in this country tuition is even partially paid by tax dollars. I'm not saying students aren't important or that they must work or that students aren't overwhelmed with school work, I'm saying that at this time they haven't contributed yet. And that's okay, I know students will contribute after leaving school. It's just that they aren't contributing right now.  Even the 15 year old worked during their school year. So I think at least discussing for students to contribute during this time, even during a pandemic, shouldn't be shut down. I think its even worse to incentivize students to not contribute during a pandemic.

I think policy that encourages a percentage of the population to not work, is crippling to society. This problem also exists in CERB, but those receiving CERB already paid EI. Both benefits have their problems from the start. I do hope to see reform of both to help those that fell through the cracks.

Ideally, I would want to see an income based topup corresponding to last years income to income during the federal shutdown. If someone earned $1000 during april last year, and now they earn $800, they get $200. If they earned $1000 last year and this year they earn $0 they earn $1000. I feel like less people would fall through the cracks.

I know text sometimes isn't the best way to communicate, but I do hope people do not take offense from this and I apologize to those that do. While I was annoyed by the narrative of this reddit, I only wanted to speak up as I feel there was something being overlooked. I'm not against criticism so if you think im misinformed or overlooking something myself I would like to learn more about this. 

**TL;DR:** Even if cons are going about this the wrong way, CESB does encourage individuals to not pursue work which is bad for the country. Also notice of individuals on CERB paid EI while working meaning CESB shouldn't be held to the same standards as CERB.",2,1588666902.0,2020,2020-05-05,,ThunderBack,0,gdttds

Waiting to start new job,"Hi,

I'm in an interesting situation and I'm trying to figure out what kind of funding help I can get.

Basically, I was under contract until April 24th, and had a new job due to start on May 25th. Due to slowed security clearance processing for government jobs though, my start date has been indefinitely postponed. 

This puts me in a situation where I'm technically unemployed because I have yet to officially sign an employment offer (I can only sign once my clearance is granted). 

I'm not eligible for CERB because a contract ended, meaning I didn't lose my job to COVID. However, if I apply for CESB, I get put in a job bank. As I already have a job lined up, I can't really be ""seeking work"" so am I even eligible for CESB or do I just have no options for emergency benefits while I wait for my clearance to be processed and start my new job?

I was eligible for CERB for the previous 4-week period (April 15th to May 15th) as I had to indefinitely put my one-to-one client sessions as a special needs youth worker on hold due to the social distancing guidelines, and the virus putting my immunocompromised clients at risk.

The sessions for my last client would have terminated mid-May upon the start of my summer courses regardless of whether covid-19 had occured or not, but the virus has stopped me from looking for, and taking on any additional clients during the summer months.

Grad Students and CESB/CERB,"Any info for research stream grad students looking into applying for CERB/CESB? I feel like I am not alone here in that winter TA contracts have expired and continuation of research is uncertain. My TA contract expired April 28, and my plans to work part time at the university over the summer obviously fell through. I have applied for summer TA positions, but am 99% sure I haven't been given the position. 

Eligibility for CERB seems to be so ambiguous with wording like ""stopped work for reasons related to COVID 19."" I wouldn't expect the expiration of a TA contract/closure of labs to qualify under 'reasons related to COVID19', but at the same time if it weren't for COVID19 I would likely have employment through the university. 

Also with CESB I am worried about the clause of students having to ""attest to the fact that they are seeking work."" It is not that I am unwilling to work, but I am worried about the ability to maintain employment considering my research can pick back up at basically any time, and I would be unable to work full time.

Have I messed up my chance to receive benefits?,"***if this post does not belong here, I only ask that someone directs me to where I *can* ask my question. I tried the phone line but it never even lets me wait on hold 

I applied for CERB the day before Trudeau announced the emergence of CESB. I received the $2000 cheque in the mail but have not touched it since I got it because of the announcement. 

**I met the $5000 minimum earned income for 2019 requirement for CERB and most other requirements, but did not *stop working* due to the pandemic because I have been an unemployed full-time-student**

Siuational Details: 
I am a university student and the last time I was employed was part-time seasonal during 2019-2020 holiday season. I have been using my tax return to pay my room and board to my mother but that money won't last forever. I have been job-searching but have had little to no luck (I'm assuming it's pretty competitive right now).  

I tried applying to eia but the intake person on the phone told me that I would not get eia because I probably qualify for for CERB or CESB and said that there was no point in completing the eia application so we ended the intake appointment half way through. 

Dilemma: 
I fear that despite receiving the cheque, I may not be fully eligible for the CERB and don't want to take any risks/spend money that I don't actually have. 

**My bigger fear is that having applied for and received the CERB (despite my eligibility being questionable at best), that it will make me ineligible for CESB, which I probably would have qualified for.**

Will I get nothing? How can I sort this out?

My current plan: 
My CRA online day is tomorrow, and I plan on applying for CESB then. I will hold onto the CERB cheque until I get more information on what I'm to do, but once I am sure that I can get CESB, I'll mail it back to the Sudbury return address. 

Bottom Line: 
Should I apply to CESB tomorrow? Would the website even *let me* apply since I got CERB (despite not being able to use it) for the same period or whatever? Would returning the cheque ASAP help me in any way or should I hold on to it until I someday am able to get a hold of someone from CRA/am sure I can't have it? 

What are your recommendations on what I should do next based on my situation?

If you can't do simple research on your own or even click the pinned post here, I'm concerned for your future - it's not hard to find

No, you don't have to pay it back unless you are overpaid or claiming it fraudulently (international students rekt)

You may or may not qualify, it is not up to us to decide this, read the qualification guidelines and decide for yourself; use common sense, once again, if you can't decide for yourself I feel worried for your future

Also,

You don't HAVE to work, it's just some BS thing they threw in, they do the same thing with other provincial and federal benefits like EI and whatever; it's just a safeguard so the Conservatives stop sucking each other off about farm labour and makes them think we're looking for jobs even though there are slim to none atm - don't stress it, just click the checkmark and say you're ""looking"" for jobs

If it comes down to it, apply online to jobs you know you won't get and write down the date just to make it look like you're looking (only if the CESB requires proof of that)

Question about the job pool complaints,"I’ve seen so many people say it’s unfair hat we’d have to prove we’re looking for a job and we can’t deny jobs and the like. Why is this an issue for some people? The whole point of it is to help students get money if they can’t work, I’m missing how it’s so bad that we have to try to find a job? If you want money you need a job, it’s fantastic that the government is trying to help us be able to pay for things while it’s hard to find a job. People are complaining about farming jobs? Why? We usually have mass amounts of immigrants to help with these jobs but that’s not available right now and we still need to farm to feed people. CESB isn’t just about handing out money just because, it’s meant to help people who can’t get work because of covid, it makes total sense that you don’t qualify if you turned down a job. I know that it might seem like they’re calling students lazy by doing it this way but people are kind of probing them right by literally complaining that the jobs available are rent good enough. Also the reason why people on CERB don’t have this is because they should have a job to go back to, it’s for people who can’t work right now because of the virus, not for students who now can’t find a job due to it.

Are student parents eligible while daycares are closed?,"My spouse and I are parents as well as students. I'm doing full-time PhD work over the summer, but I also lost a summer teaching gig due to the pandemic, so I'm probably going to apply for the CERB.

My spouse has to look after our child because daycares are closed. She is **not** going to look for a job, obviously, because watching a kid is full-time, but she didn't lose a job either. 

So the question is: **Is someone eligible for CESB if they are unable to work due to having to care for a dependent while daycares are closed?**

The eligibility guidelines of the law says: ""For reasons related to COVID-19... be unable to work"" which would suggest that caring for your child would count.

"Either make every unemployed person receiving CERB or CESB somehow prove they're looking for work, or ask it of nobody - to ask it of only students is rather condescending","I'm honestly trying to be fair and patient, but really, this 'students are all lazy freeloaders' philosophy isn't only insulting, it's also illogical. The entire reason these programs exist is because at this point in time, there simply aren't enough job openings to go around, and the ones that do still exist aren't options for everyone. Are we really expecting some 19-year-old software engineering major to go off and work the fields? Are we assuming that farmers have the time to fart around training hordes of 100% unqualified undergrads to use complex farming equipment? Plus, what of mature students? Most of my classes have had at least a few students who, and I mean them no disrespect, seemed maybe a bit less physically robust than they were in their twenties or thirties.

Plus, I'm stumbling across minimum one article or news segment a day about how to maintain sanity and happiness under lockdown - that tells me that whether or not it's an option for them, *most people don't want to stay holed up at home doing nothing*. Why would this be any less true for students?

The 'students don't deserve food or shelter because they don't want to work' argument also falls apart when you think about the many who had job offers lined up which have since fallen through. Why would someone unwilling to work have accepted an offer for work? Plus, are we collectively forgetting that a huge number of students became students specifically to work in positions that require degrees? Why would a lazy person go to medical school when there are jobs that don't require years and years of studying?

Students aren't lazy, or entitled, or disposable. They just had the misfortune of being students at the point when the entire planet got hit by a once-in-a-century pandemic.

CESB Eligibility for a Convoluted Situation,"I'm a 2nd year university student studying in Canada and I was wondering if I'd be eligible for the CESB.

I don't have any financial aid from FAFSA or US gov't agencies despite filing taxes under the IRS (not the CRA). Instead, I receive grants and loans from OSAP. 

To be concise, I have never worked in Canada or filed taxes in Canada to the CRA because I have only worked summer jobs in the States and I filed US taxes. I was wondering if my being a domestic Canadian student and having a SIN considers me eligible for the CESB because I could use the help since I can't work in the States this summer. Also, does my permanent residence being in the USA affect this? I can't make a My CRA account because I have never worked/filed taxes in Canada, and thus I get an error when trying to register.

Question about CESB!,"Hello ya'll! 

So I am currently in uni. Deciding to take the summer off and go back on uni by September or January 2021 (preferably). 

I've been working at Walmart for a year now. I've been picking more hours as I go because some of my siblings got laid off, so I have to help with rent and bills. I have heard about the CESB and I don't qualify because I make more than 1000$ a month. Then, two employees tested positive at work. I live with my grandparents, and  I don't want to risk their health. Especially my grandpa has COPD. So by this month of may, I have decided to work only part time, maybe once or twice a week in order to qualify for the 1000$ a month. The problem is, I made more than 1000$ for the month of April. Will I qualify for the month of May?

Question about Freelancing,"Hi everyone,

I'm a student who does freelancing (web design) on the side during the summer to make some extra money and for experience to put on my resume.

I guess you could say I am self-employed.

To the best of my understanding, to apply for the CESB you need to be a student who is either a) unemployed and seeking employment or b) a student who is already employed (whether that be regular employment or self-employment).

I am self-employed. So how would I ""prove"" that to the CRA when I'm applying for the CESB? I only started freelancing about 2 weeks ago and made a little bit of money. Would I show them an eTransfer that I received for the payment of my services or something?

The text of the employment insurance act,"Howdy all

While we continue to wait and speculate on how CESB will be implemented, and specifically whether they will implement an employment requirement, you might find it interesting to compare the text of C-15 with that of the employment insurance act. This is an interesting exercise because EI has work requirements. You will see that the act governing the EI program explicitly spells out the work requirement. For example, take a look at the section entitled “Disentitlement to Benefits”. This section explicitly prescribes conditions under which a recipient loses their rights to the benefit. The section beneath it entitled “Deductions from Benefits” is also relevant. 

The point I am trying to make is that laws pertaining to the disbursement of benefits are not written ambiguously - especially if one objective is to curtail fraud. If there were circumstances in which students could be disentitled to the benefit, it would have been codified into law. Perhaps it could be argued that by falsely attesting to seeking employment, a student would no longer be entitled to the benefit. I’m not a lawyer but I imagine such an argument could lead to a court challenge since the act does not spell any of this out. It seems to me that the omission of any kind of language related to work requirements was intentional because there aren’t any. CESB is open to all students who for any reason are unable to work this summer. I don’t think that anyone has anything to worry about with respect to work seeking 

This is not legal advice, I am not a lawyer.

-0 seasonal jobs
-When using just the location and ""student"" filters, there are only 13 positions, all of which are full-time (I cannot apply for these as I'm taking a summer term)

It is up to students to contact your local MPs, the opposition parties like the NDP to take notice do that no one is forced to take a job you are unable to do. Students need to advocate for:

2. **Have the option to work in another field but that is the students option, it must be optional**
3. **Exempt those with dependents, taking care of immunocompromised (or are one), and with disabilities from participating**

New Update! (Thanks to u/slckpd) 

**New post-secondary students with classes starting on or before February 1, 2021, who were not enrolled in high school in 2020, should have documents showing that: their application for admission into a post-secondary program was accepted before the four-week CESB period for which they applied.**

# FAQ's on Application, CRA and Taxes

**When can I apply for CESB?** 

Application has been opened since May 15th, 2020 at 6am EST. Go to your CRA account or register if you haven't yet:  [https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html)

**Will I have to apply based on the day of my birth month?**

It's been taken down for now. 

~~If the only way to apply for the CESB is through the CRA, then that is based on your Birth Month.  If you were born in the months of January, February, or March, you can apply on Mondays. April, May, or June you can apply on Tuesdays. July, August, or September you can apply on Wednesdays. October, November, or December you can apply on Thursdays. For the days of Friday, Saturday and Sunday, this is for everyone.~~

**Can you re-apply for CESB?**

If this is like the CERB, you may be able to re-apply for the CESB. So for example you are entitled for May and got the CESB for that month. Then you worked for June and July (over $1000/mo in a 4 week period), but are no longer working in August due to a layoff or contract ending, you can apply for August. So in this situation you got CESB for May and August.

**Will I go to jail or get punished if I take the CESB but realize I wasn't qualified?**

No, according to Minister Qualtrough at the May 13th episode of CBC's Power &amp; Politics, the government won't charge interest or penalize you for taking out the CESB. You just have to return it back. It doesn't mean they won't ask for it back, they can at any time if they find out you're ineligible.

**When is the latest I can apply for CESB?**

You have till September 30th, 2020 to apply. Thereafter no one is entitled to the CESB even if you qualified for it.

**How do I open up a CRA account if I don't have one?**

File for your 2019 tax return and go to [https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html)

**Will there be an alternative to a CRA account (UPDATE)?**

As far as we know no. There is an automated phone line you can call with CRA if you can’t access online at 1-800-959-8281 (opens up phone application) or 1-800-959-2041

**I have never filed a tax return then how do I get it?**

Call 1-800-959-8281 to activate your SIN if you have never filed a tax return. File your tax return as soon as possible plus if you're at least 19 years of age you can get GST/HST credit even if you earned $0 in income. You may even qualify for provincial benefits too. In Ontario for example for those 19 and over there is the Ontario Trillium Benefit.

**Will we have to pay taxes to the CRA for getting the CESB? (UPDATE)**

The CESB is taxable and you will get a T4A Slip next year. However if you meet the basic personal exemption amount (federal) of earning less than $13,229 for 2020, you won't need to pay for it. Please check the personal exemption for your province to see if you would have to pay provincial taxes (Ontario it's $10,783 for 2020). Also if you live in a province where you can receive the Climate Action Incentive (ON, MB, SK, AB), you can find out how much of it you will get in a tax refund, to make any future calculations in how much you owe, if any (in ON you will get back $295 next year for a single adult).

**Can we be audited for CESB? (NEW)**

""Auditing"" process would likely be:

1. Upon application check SIN, age of applicant, look for duplicates (or CERB/EI payments made in the period)
2. They will **audit** if there is **suspicion** (e.g. Want to see job activities, proof of claims)
3. They can **review** (which is NOT an audit)
4. Review examples such as checking for those who claimed $2000 by looking at the CCB record (unless they do it already in the application stage). Check your T2202 tax form from previous year or current year. Review is more so done later.
5. There will be more emphasis on the CERB for now due to the whole ""fraudster"" situation, but this does not mean they won't target CESB .

# FAQ's on Eligibility and Criteria

**Who can apply for CESB? (UPDATE)**

Students who are enrolled at any time between December 1, 2019 and August 31, 2020, in a post-secondary educational program that leads to a degree, diploma or certificate.

New Graduates from December 2019 onward. According to the Backgrounder, students who LEFT their post-secondary studies no earlier than December 2019 can also apply.

High school graduates of 2020 ONLY (according to Backgrounder) who are joining post-secondary school prior to February 1st, 2021.

**What if I am 30 years old do I qualify?**

There is no age requirement.

**If I am a High School student can I get it for all four months? (UPDATE)**

No, Minister Qualtrough confirmed that they can only apply for two months. However if you graduated before a certain period you can qualify for it so for example you graduated before May 10th, you can qualify for the first period onward.

**Can I apply if I am enrolling in September but not a high school graduate of 2020? (UPDATE AGAIN)**

From CRA: The CESB is only available to eligible students who: completed or expect to complete high school, or received, or expect to receive their high school equivalency in 2020 applied for a post-secondary educational program that starts before February 1, 2021

From the Backgrounder: Only high school students who graduate in 2020 (are eligible)

Minister Qualtrough however says that **Gap Students** are eligible. As always if in doubt call the CRA.

**Can I apply if I study abroad?**

Yes as long as you meet all criteria.

**I'm outside of Canada but don't live in Canada can I get the CESB? (NEW)**

To receive benefits you have to file tax returns and have significant ties to Canada like a place of residence, spouse or dependent. You can determine your residency here: [https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/information-been-moved/determining-your-residency-status.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/information-been-moved/determining-your-residency-status.html)

**Can I apply if I am at a private post-secondary institution?**

Yes. This was confirmed in the Senate.

**Can  I apply if I am in an Apprenticeship program?**

Yes (according to Backgrounder).

**Do I qualify if I am in Open Studies? (UPDATE)**

Some are being told they qualify. It is best to ask the CRA directly to confirm. If they tell you you are eligible, keep a record of the agent's name, the date and time you had the conversation.

**If I am on social or income assistance can I apply?**

Although it's considered income and may not make you eligible (it's best to ask the CRA about programs like ODSP), currently NWT has confirmed they won’t penalize those on income assistance for taking the CESB.

**I am an International Student can I apply?**

No. You must be a Canadian Citizen, Permanent Resident, protected person, or have status under the Indian Act.

**Is there an eligibility criteria? (UPDATE)**

Yes, there are three categories of the criteria that can make you qualify (only one is needed). Students must attest that it's for COVID-19 reasons (according to the Background):

1. You are unable to work due to COVID-19 (according to the Act you had to have been employed or self-employed prior to being unable to work), OR
2. You are looking for, but cannot find work due to COVID-19, OR
3. You are currently working during the COVID-19 pandemic, but your income from employment and self-employment has been $1,000 or less (before taxes) during the 4-week period you are applying for. CRA agents are telling students your earnings had to have been reduced because of covid-19.

**What if I make more than $1000 am I eligible? (NEW)**

Unfortunately at this time no, but Minister Qualtrough says the government is considering the possibility of a clawback system for those who earn more than $1000. It is not implemented at this time.

**What if I get grants, stipends or other income is that included as part of the $1000 maximum? (UPDATE)**

The following forms of income that are included as part of the $1000 maximum: employment income, self-employment income, taxable benefits/allowances provided by an employer, tips, non-eligible dividends, honoraria, and royalties.

The following are NOT included as part of the $1000 maximum: pensions, student grants and loans, scholarships, bursaries, graduate stipends family, common-law, and spousal income graduate stipends and bursaries educational funding for indigenous students through the Post-Secondary Student Support Program (PSSSP)

# FAQ's on Jobs

**What do you mean by ""attest that you are seeking employment""? (UPDATE)**

CESB recipients need to be looking for work and you will be attesting during the application process that you are looking for work. However this is only for those who are ""able to work"". More details are needed regarding whether those who make under $1000 need to find work.

**What is the ""job bank"" and why am I going to be enrolled? (UPDATE)**

Students who receive the CESB are given a link to the Canada Job Bank ( [https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/findajob/resources/cesb](https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/findajob/resources/cesb) ) where you can apply for jobs in highly demanded sectors such as agriculture or restaurants, or jobs that you want to work in and notify you about it (through email). It is however not mandatory to register to the Job Bank, but highly recommended by the CRA to open a Plus account since it'll be easier to keep track of the jobs you applied for (you can still register for Standard). You can apply for jobs at other sites like Indeed or LinkedIn.

**Will I lose my CESB if I refuse an offer at the job bank? (UPDATE)**

According to Minister Qualtrough, you will not be forced to take a job, but you must attest that you aren't refusing jobs and are looking.

The CRA says: “The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) may ask you to provide information later to verify that you have been looking for work during the eligibility period(s) that you have applied for, so it is important to keep track of your daily job search activities.”

**How do I prove I am seeking a job? (NEW)**

You can join the Job Bank and open a Plus Account. You can record it on your smartphone Notes app, or a spreadsheet, or use Service Canada's job search form ([https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/apps/EForms/pdf/en/SC-INS5240.pdf](https://catalogue.servicecanada.gc.ca/apps/EForms/pdf/en/SC-INS5240.pdf)), or keep screenshots of your daily activities. It's up to you, just as long as you keep a record of your daily job activities so you can provide CRA proof of your ongoing job search.

**What kind of job activities need to be recorded? (NEW)**

Confirmed job activities include: Browsing and applying for job postings online; Preparing a resume or cover letter; Attending virtual job search workshops; Taking career orientation quizzes. Cold-calling employers; Attending a job interview.

Although not confirmed, Service Canada for example does take into account additional job activities such as registering for job search tools/agencies/job banks, networking, job fairs, and evaluations of competencies.

**What if I find a new Job what do I do then? (NEW)**

Congratulations! If you make under $1000 during the period you applied for you may still be eligible as far as we are aware. If you make more than $1000 in a period you applied for you will have to return it. If you got a job in the next period and know you will earn more than $1000, but have not applied for a CESB, nothing else is needed to be done, you just don't apply for CSEB.

**I don't want to work can I still get the CESB? (NEW)**

The **CESB is an income replacement** for a job (or business) you had and lost it/unable to work because of covid-19, or a job (or business) you were planning to start soon, or you were planning to work in the summer, or at your current job (or business) your earnings have been reduced to under $1000 in a 4 week qualifying period. It's **not a student grant.**

**Do student loans or government grants deny you CESB?**

Loans are not income so they have no effect. Government grants aren't considered income even though it is reported on a T4A, if you are a full-time student. If the grant is unrelated to your studies (e.g. you're in a BSc program but you got an art grant) it may be part of income.

# FAQ's on Payments

**How much do I get paid?**

$1250/month to Students

$2000/month to Students with dependents or with a disability.

**How do I get the money?**

You need to setup direct deposit (payment that will go directly into your bank account) in your CRA account if you haven't yet. Otherwise you will get a cheque.

**How long does it take for a direct deposit or a cheque to arrive?**

If this is like the CERB, after you apply it will take 3 business days for a direct deposit or 10 business days for a cheque.

**Is it a lump sum or do I get money per week?**

If this is like the CERB, you will get a lump sum for the last 4 week period of $1250 or $2000 depending on your eligibility.

**I got a double payment what does that mean?**

If you are a student that got a double payment of $2500, you need to return $1250 back if it was accidental by CRA. However, if you were eligible for two months' worth (e.g. for May and June) and applied later, you may be getting $2500 for both months. Keep track of all your payments. If you get more you need to return the surplus. If you get less, you need to notify CRA.

**Do I have to pay back the CESB?**

No. Other than taxes which is explained above or if you got an overpayment, you don't have to pay the CESB back since it's a benefit. However if you are not eligible and you take the CESB, you will have to pay it back.

**Do I have to apply once for it to get paid for May to August?**

No, it's going to likely be similar to the CERB. You will likely have to apply at least four times if you want to receive it from May to August. You have to still meet the criteria each time you apply.

# Other CESB FAQs

**WHY DID THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE TO SCREW US OVER? (NEW)**

While the Conservatives did push for students to attest to work, the Bloc were also responsible for it as well as they were concerned students weren't going to work. On the other hand, most tend to forget that after Covid-19, any emergency HoC session that has a motion or bill has to have **unanimous consent in order to pass**. The bill had consent of all parties including the Liberals, NDP, Greens, Conservatives, and the Bloc.

**What does ""dependents"" mean?**

From CRA: A child (adopted child, stepchild, or foster child) who is under 12 years old and is completely dependent on the student, student’s spouse, or common-law partner for support, care, and upbringing.

**If I get a job in July, can I still continue to get the CESB?**

As far as we are aware if the job is going to pay more than $1000/mo than you can't apply for the specified period. You can keep previous CESB payments.

**What if things get back to normal in the summer will the CESB get canceled?**

Currently there is no evidence that the CESB would be canceled. Although restrictions may be loosened and this is up to the provinces, we expect precautionary measures to continue in some form till a proven treatment or vaccine is made available.

**Can I switch from CERB to CESB?**

If you are on the CERB, we recommend staying on since it pays more ONLY if you are still eligible, if you are not then do not reapply for CERB. If your CERB has ended then you may be able to get CESB thereafter, but not for the period of time you received CERB. You can't receive CESB and CERB at the same time.

**I still doubt that I can get the CESB what can I do?**

Wait till the application opens up, see if any new changes have been made that would apply to your situation and if still in doubt, call the CRA (after the application is out).

# FAQs on Other Government Services and Grants

**What is the Canada Student Service Grant (CSSG)?**

It is for students who choose to do national service and serve their communities this summer. It will provide between $1000-$5000 to students studying this fall. It will be called the ""I Want to Help"" platform.

**What has been updated for the Canada Student Grants (CSG) program?**

If you qualify (students in QC, NWT, and Nunavut do not qualify), when you apply for student loans, you could receive double CSG for Full Time Students for 2020-21 only (Sept 2020 to Aug 2021). You can get doubling on other CSG grants such as for those with dependents or disability and a doubling of CSG for Part Time Students. These grants will be doubled to a maximum amount (up to $6000 for a regular full-time CSG).

**What is new for Student Loans?**

For 2020-21 only, student and spousal contributions are removed. Maximum weekly amount will be increased from $210 to $350. Student loans (federal) are also currently interest free and no payments required till September 30th, 2020.

**What else is being offered?**

116,000 new jobs are expected under current federal, skills development and youth programming programs

Support for student researchers and post-doctoral fellows

Am I eligible if I already found a job?,"I saw another question similar to this one, but it hadn't been answered yet so I'm posting anyway.

I already have a summer position lined up and have signed a contract, but my start date was pushed back by nearly a month and I likely won't be receiving a paycheque until mid-June. Because of this, I won't be able to cover my expenses for May but am unsure of how the ""incentive"" thing will impact me. I'm confused as to whether I actually qualify for CESB, which requires students to attest they're looking for a job, since I'm already technically employed and not looking for work anymore. 

I'm not sure if anyone even knows at this point -- but is CESB intended for students who currently have no job/income prospects lined up or could someone in my position, who only needs it temporarily, still qualify?",1,1588341440.0,2020,2020-05-01,,vrh96,1,gbijrv

Are students that did a gap year eligible for CESB?,"I took a gap year after I graduated high school in 2019, and I read a post made earlier this week asking the same question with the response being that it would most likely be available (and I accepted my program for college this fall 2020 semester. However, after reading the Gov't of Canada website it noted these points:

* Students who are enrolled in a post-secondary education program leading to a degree, diploma, or certificate;
* students who ended their studies or graduated no earlier than December 2019;
* high-school graduates who have applied for and will be joining post-secondary programs in the coming months; and
* Canadian students studying abroad meeting one of the above criteria.

CESB for recent graduates?,"I am fortunate enough to still be employed for the next 9 months at least, but was wondering if there are any CESB benefits I can use. For context, I worked full time and was in school full time for the past 12 months(3 semesters straight). I have accrued an additional ~11k in student debt through the process, and am now seeing that student grants will be doubled as part of the CESB. My gross income for 2019 was around 35k but will be closer to 60k for 2020. I understand that many are in a worse situation than me, but am somewhat regretting pushing myself so hard to finish school in the last year, knowing that If I added a semester I'd have around 4000$ less to repay. I had to make a lot of sacrifices with my health, social and family relationships to finish it in time. The only things that apply to recent grads are for unemployed people and a freeze on student loan interest, is anyone aware of other benefits for recent grads?

RE: Job banks? How exactly will this work...?,"So how exactly do you think this Job Bank thing will work? I’m seeing a lot of different ideas and I’m just confused and worried.

I can’t drive into the city to work a retail job, and I’m not physically fit enough or mentally well enough (I have really bad anxiety) to work on a farm or a fishery. I’m just concerned that the government is going to turn around and say that I’m not allowed the benefit, or that they’re going to automatically hire me for a job I’m not going to be able to work because of travel reasons.

Does anybody know when you are technically considered to be Enrolled for the Fall Semester?,"As a mature student, I'm a little worried about the wording on the bill that defines a student. Over the past few years, I have been working part-time and taking 12U courses that thankfully resulted in my acceptance to University for the Fall. However, any plans to work full time from April-August are no longer possible and I will be continuing my part-time job until and throughout the school year. The financial assistance from the CESB would be a blessing but I feel as though I will fall through the gaps. 

Based on the following criteria that define what the government acknowledges as a student, I will not be considered a student unless I am ""enrolled"" before August 31st:

*(a) is enrolled, at any time between December 1, 2019 and August 31, 2020, in a post-secondary educational program that leads to a degree, diploma or certificate;*

*(b) has graduated from secondary school in 2020, has applied for enrollment in such a post-secondary educational program that is scheduled to begin before February 1, 2021 and plans to enroll in the program if their application is accepted; or*

*(c) is a member of a class of persons that is prescribed by regulation.‍ (étudiant)*

So as per the title of this thread, does anybody know when you are technically considered to be ""Enrolled""?

Switching from CERB to CESB looks legal albeit not simultaneously,"So long as your application periods of CERB and CESB don't overlap, the way the bill is written you can qualify for both and switch over. Here is the text of the bill-

*Students*

**(b)** they do not, in respect of any part of that four-week period, receive

**(i)** subject to the regulations, income from employment or self-employment,

**(ii)** *benefits*, as defined in subsection 2(1) of the *Employment Insurance Act*, or an employment insurance emergency response benefit referred to in section 153.‍7 of that Act,

**(iii)** allowances, money or other benefits that would be paid to the student under a provincial plan because of pregnancy or in respect of the care by the student of one or more of their new-born children or one or more children placed with them for the purpose of adoption,

Help with my CERB/CESB situation? Student grant?,"Hey all, I hope you're well considering everything. 

As of now, I'm on CERB as the gym I worked at part-time shut down. I'm getting it through EI.

I'm a full time student, and am still going to be so during the next school year. 

I'm also volunteering a couple of hours a week at local cancer patient PT center, and I got temporarily hired to work at long-term care facilities as an aid to the nursing staff (I found it super important to help out now that they're super short staffed). Although I made sure that I'm earning less than 1000$ a month. My volunteering would allow me to earn the 1700$ a month via CESB right?


As I started receiving CERB benefits March 15, they'll most likely end July 15 right? Once that's over I'd be able to apply to the CESB? can I do it before? Together? I'd also want my EI to end immediately when the CESB ends right? I don't think I'd be getting much money from EI once CERB ends..

Do you think the volunteering/work that I'm doing would also qualify me for a grant towards my education by the federal government?

Thanks in advance for the help! Wishing you all nothing but the best.",9,1588208733.0,2020,2020-04-29,,GoldenBella,3,galygm

Government Bill (House of Commons) C-15 (43-1) - First Reading - Canada Emergency Student Benefit Act - Parliament of Canada,,38,1588187428.0,2020,2020-04-29,,dvd_man,13,gafib6
House of Commons debate on CESB with Updates thread,"The HoC debate for the CESB Bill is taking place starting today at 2:30pm EST. You can follow it at  [https://www.cpac.ca/en/](https://www.cpac.ca/en/) This will be updated with important progress on the Bill. Standby. -*Warriorlynx*

**BILL C-15 has been adopted and passed through all stages (in HoC)! The Bill now goes to the Senate on Friday and after Royal Assent an application process will start soon thereafter (Mid-May is estimated) through CRA.**

**UPDATE:** Second Reading end, motion adopted for Third Reading, House has ended

**UPDATE:** Greens like that the amount of the benefit can change through the Ministry of Finance, but disappointed about no International Student support.

**UPDATE:** NDP welcomes double student grants in the Bill, but wants to see it permanent.  They recommend a new post-secondary Act for new programs. Disappointed with no support for International Students.

**UPDATE:** Bloc supports CESB. They says the bill has ""glitches"", say they're generous in their co-operation but they want incentives (in that you can still work while getting CESB). It should be designed so that it encourages them to work.

**UPDATE:** Conservatives are looking to support the bill but want more programs made available for students. They negotiated that **all applicants would be part of the job bank, parliamentary review will take place of the program, and no extension for the CESB.** Another MP doesn't want to support the bill unless it's no longer a disincentive.

**UPDATE:** Liberals willing to look at agriculture sector for students to be matched under the Canada Student Jobs program as proposed by the Conservatives.

**UPDATE:** NDP argue $1250 isn't justifiable if a 15 year old who earned $5000 can get $2000/mo, while a post-grad gets $1250. Liberals respond that they are increasing the Federal granting council for research

**UPDATE:** Conservatives (Erin O'Toole) say that half of the 9 billion should be invested into incentives while the other half should be a $1000 credit for tuition.

**UPDATE:** Liberals are willing to debate Universal Basic Income, but this isn't the time right now. They still referenced in the house for students with dependents/disabilities at $1750/mo instead of $2000.

**UPDATE:** 1 million students didn't qualify for CERB.

**UPDATE:** Jagmeet Singh still wants CERB to be universal and that it can be taxed back next year. Says that Liberals think that students with children and disability deserve less help. Says he pushed the Liberals which is why it's $2000 instead of $1750. **Places motion for a Universal CERB, but no unanimous consent is given.** NDP wants interest to end for student loans permanently.

**UPDATE: From First Reading: No student is permitted to file an application (for CESB) after September 30, 2020.**

**UPDATE:** Bloc wants a compromise and proposes that students can keep part of their salary before being penalized. If student earns $3500/mo they lose the benefit.

**UPDATE: First Reading Eligibility Criteria:** (a) for reasons related to the coronavirus disease 2019 and whether as an employee or in self-employment, they are unable to work, are seeking work and unable to find it, or are working but are paid less than the amount determined under the regulations, during the four-week period for which they apply for the benefit; and (b) (get EI, are working more than $1000/mo, or any other allowances/money that is paid under a provincial plan such as pregnancy or care for a new-born or any income support payment under CERB

**UPDATE:** From First Reading - CESB is not subject to bankruptcy/insolvency or is garnishible moneys.

**UPDATE:** NDP argue it's 40% less of a payment for students even though there are upcoming grants. Their needs and rents/groceries are due now. This is just forcing them to take on more debt.

**UPDATE: Defining Student for the CESB according to First Reading**:  (a) is enrolled, at any time between December 1, 2019 15 and August 31, 2020, in a post-secondary educational program that leads to a degree, diploma or certificate; (b) has graduated from secondary school in 2020, has applied for enrollment in such a post-secondary educational program that is scheduled to begin before 20 February 1, 2021 and plans to enroll in the program if their application is accepted; or is a member of a class of persons that is prescribed by regulation.

**UPDATE:** **Here is Bill C-15 First Reading summary** [https://www.parl.ca/Content/Bills/431/Government/C-15/C-15\_1/C-15\_1.PDF](https://www.parl.ca/Content/Bills/431/Government/C-15/C-15_1/C-15_1.PDF)

**UPDATE:** Bloc wants a balance between Liberal and Conservative proposals. Businesses need workers, students also need help and shouldn't be penalized for wanting to work. They are in favour of students who want to work. $1250/mo will allow students the future of their studies. Students shouldn't lose $1250/mo if they are still working in the summer and wants measures so that if students are working in the summer they will continue to get CESB.

**UPDATE:** NDP MP arguing against Conservative talking points about disincentives and says that there aren't jobs in Restaurants as Conservatives claim (especially when students have a lot of debt).

**UPDATE:** Conservative MP from Kenora (who was a student last summer), knows it's a challenge for students who have bills to pay. Is upset that students were left out in the original efforts (like CERB), says no student wants to have free time on their resume. Proposes new programs for agriculture/agri-food sector and the government has accepted the proposal. Supports CESB on top of new programs (as a purpose so that they have a living wage).

**UPDATE:** Conservatives are worried that students will stay at home instead of work and the CESB looks like a disincentive. Doesn't want an extension to the bill. It's not perfect they say, but they know it'll help students. They want everyone to be helped, but argue that there are still jobs available for students. They want incentives for Students working in Agri-Food sector. They plan for a motion for many sectors such as fisheries so that students can get these jobs.

**UPDATE:** Bloc  wants number of hours worked as part of eligibility for CERB for students so they can continue to work (no mention of CESB? This seems vague)

**UPDATE:** Conservatives are talking about shortages for those who hire students, but students are refusing to work. Freeland responds that she understands the challenges in farms. She says it'll be hard for many of them to find work, though students want to work. It should be an ""incentive"" to students says Freeland.

**UPDATE:** **Service Grant (volunteer work) supports up to $5000 for the summer. Doubling of student grants for 2020-21. Student loans increased to 350/wk**.

**UPDATE:** Freeland says there was a 28% drop in Student employment in March compared to last year. They may be able to apply for CERB if they qualify.

**UPDATE:** Greens want eligibility for International Students. Liberals say the CESB is only for Canadian Citizens and Permanent Residents. International Students have already seen a relaxation on their 20 hour/wk policy.

**UPDATE:** **$1250/mo - May to Aug for students, $2000/mo - May to Aug for student with dependents and disability**. Post-secondary students including colleges (certificates too) and high school graduates are eligible

**UPDATE:** They want Second Reading today (looks like it started already) so they can get this over with.

**UPDATE:** An additional $250 is being considered for those with dependents and disabilities on top of $1750/mo. Will follow up with this.

**UPDATE:** First Reading begins, ~~Second Reading will occur at next sitting (meaning this might take longer than when CERB went through).~~

**UPDATE:** The Bill is called **C-15** **“An Act respecting Canada emergency student benefits (coronavirus disease 2019)”** This is the only government bill listed so it's specific to students, there are two private member bills that is expected to be presented.

**UPDATE:** Pre-Debate: Bill was received by opposition over the weekend for review. Conservatives want incentives for young people to take available jobs instead of staying at home and collecting money. Liberals are open to changing the bill according to a government official. NDP and Greens are pushing for the aid package to expand, they are looking at those with dependents and International Students.

Wage Funding for Non-Profits,"Hi everyone,

I have a prospective job lined up at a non-profit youth organization in Halifax. However, since the organization will not be able to run normal camps, the board wants to cut off their portion of the funding for the position (20%, the other 80% comes from grants). The director of the program and I both want to maintain the job, but run smaller and more direct projects with 1 or 2 youth at a time, to stay in accordance with social distancing measures.

Is there any funding for non-profits in the CESB that would cover some of the remaining costs, so that the position could still exist for me? I have not been able to find any information on wage subsidies for non-profit organizations yet, but it seems like keeping this kind of position open for summer students (and to provide this kind of childcare service for families) would be a chief concern.

Does anyone have any information on where this organization might be able to turn for help with funding my position? Thank you all for any help you guys might be able to offer.",1,1588099651.0,2020,2020-04-28,,LenniesMouse,1,g9sz5x

My hours did not get cut, but because of covid I've been helping my family with a lot more payments and it has hit pretty hard. My mom is on disability and as a full time student i receive 250 a month from her as well as my monthly income of around 600-900ish from dollar tree (it fluctuates a lot with hours not consistent). My school requires us to have a full pc setup with webcam etc. (game development course) so with living expenses and school expenses to keep up have hit hard. I might be making over 1000$ a month if my moms disability is counted. No clue how to apply to cerb (application says i need to be laid off) and cesb exact elegibility isn't out.

I'm curious if we will be allowed to switch to the CESB or if it would be seen as double dipping.

I also work full time in the summer (golf course), and that’s where I made over $5000. However, I am not sure if I am a student or a seasonal worker. Here is what has happened so far: 


- Winter part time job shut down early, thus loosing income 
- applied for first round CERB 
- Didn’t apply for 2nd round because the hill was going to be closed regardless of covid of not. Winter doesn’t last forever 
- Summer job, becomes delayed due to covid. 
- JT announced CERB for seasonal workers 
- Applied for 2nd round 
- JT announced plan for students. 


I meet the requirements for CERB except for the fact, that I am not sure I am a seasonal worker. I also do not go on EI throughout the school year because I have worked a part time job the past 3 years. And I only was going to apply for the first round, because the hill usually closes first week of April anyway.  But now they said seasonal workers are included, im just confused. I also called the CRA, and they told me to call back next week when they have more details on the CESB and they can answer my questions.

Canada Emergency Student Benefit - Daily Updates,"Hey everybody. I am planning to post daily (or close to daily) updates so everyone knows what the current situation is regarding CESB legislation, as well as what we know now. If anyone has more up to date information or knows something I do not, please post it with a reliable source and I will update this post accordingly.

MAY 3: The bill has passed! Full text and eligibility information can be found here: https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-1/bill/C-15/third-reading

We will update again when there is application information available. In the meantime, this is good news, and we all need to try to be patient.

APRIL 30: /u/warriorlynx: Wanted to add if anyone was interested

The Senate will sit on Friday, May 1, 2020, at 12 p.m you can watch it at  https://senparlvu.parl.gc.ca/Harmony/

APRIL 29 2.0: The ball has passed through second reading and now must be reviewed once more before making its way to Senate. After Senate comes Royal Ascent, at which point it will be law. A copy of the bill in its current form can be found here. https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/43-1/bill/C-15/first-reading

If that’s all gibberish to you, rest assured this is good news, and we have made significant progress toward having real timelines, answers, and much needed financial relief.

APRIL 29: The bill which would legalize the administration of the CESB is being debated today in the House of Commons. It is expected that there will be considerable pushback from the Conservative Party, who want to “incentivize workers”; as well as the NDP, who want broader support. We will update the post again when more information is available.

APRIL 28: from /u/warriorlynx: You can go to  https://www.cpac.ca/en/  to watch virtual parliament, CPAC says it's a debate on emergency measures so it could be talked about today.”

APRIL 27: /u/warriorlynx pointed out that Parliament will be holding a virtual sitting tomorrow. I’m not sure what’s on the agenda, but will update when I have more info.

APRIL 26: As far as I can tell there have been no additional details released. There are no significant news pieces published in the last few days related to the CESB, and nothing new on the Parliament website.

APRIL 23: At the moment I have been unable to determine if a date has been set for the House of Commons to sit and debate the specifics regarding CESB eligibility. Without legislation (law) to back up the PM’s statements, nothing is certain. I have checked, and will continue to check the government’s parliament website, as well as CPAC’s “House Portal”. 

Currently the House website says The House of Commons has been adjourned until May 25th.

This is so confusing 🤦🏻‍♀️,So My last day of work was in January because when I told my employer of 9 years I was going back to school they decided not to call me in for work on my day off or reading week etc. Then come March they phone me to say I’m laid off for the time being due to a shortage of work because of corona virus. They said they’d phone me when work picked up again but for now they’d submit my ROE to apply for EI. I was told multiple times don’t wait to apply for EI do it right away. So I did I filled out everything honestly and told EI I was full time student where I go to school etc. Then I was rolled into CERB. As more details came out I started to worry I didn’t qualify as I wasn’t working from January to March but was still employed. Keep in mind I wanted to work but wasn’t getting shifts. I was also actively looking for another job. I’ve contacted EI told her my situation but she said they’re so confused by new details everyday she basically couldn’t help me and to call CRA. She gave me the numbers and I phoned them but you can only talk to someone if applying for CERB through CRA which obviously I’m already getting CERB through EI so I can’t even speak to someone from there 🤦🏻‍♀️ now this CESB comes out and I’m even more confused and worried that I don’t qualify somehow for CERB. I’m worried I’ll have to pay that back next year and have missed out on a sure thing being the CESB instead. Does anyone else feel this way? Like I hate when anyone talks down to people in this situation or says they’re trying to rip people off.

Could I apply for CESB as a student who also applied for only one CERB payment?,"Hi everyone, I applied for CERB for the second pay period because my pay cheque was below the 1000. I'm unemployed now cause my contract has ended - and don't think I qualify for CERB anymore. Could I receive CESB? Or should I be more aware of this when they start introducing legislation and more details on this?",18,1587574258.0,2020,2020-04-22,CESB Question,qasimy,3,g64oez
Graduated IN December 2019 or AFTER 2019,"In Trudeau’s announcement today he said CESB would be available to people “who graduated in December 2019” 

Seems like a huge oversight to exclude people who are graduating in April 2020. But I’m not sure if he just said this accidentally? Does anyone have any other sources that specify whether this will be available to students graduating this month?

Need to find out if I’m going to spend the next few days emailing MPs or not...",10,1587573888.0,2020,2020-04-22,CESB Question,NormalResearch,8,g64kgn
