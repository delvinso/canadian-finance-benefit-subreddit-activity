Too much equity in Toronto home?,"Hi Everyone,

40 years old, consistent self-employed income, one toddler, single parent. I bought a semi-detached in Toronto 5 years ago (prob overpaid!) but had lots to put down due to the sale of condos purchased back when they were cheap.  Wanted to have an easy, comfortable monthly payment because I work for myself - so put down as much as possible.  it was very manageable and allowed me to raise kiddo without stress. House is now worth approx. $1M, mortgage has $300K left on it and 1.4% interest rate... am I crazy to have this much equity in one asset? Should I take some out to invest (ASAP!) or purchase other investment property, even in this bonkers market? Or just stay put and enjoy watching the mortgage get smaller? 

I have a decent RRSP, small TFSA. Perhaps that’s where to focus? Grateful to have options because I’ve been reading other housing posts on here and feeling bad for the younger first time buyers. 😕 Thanks in advance!",13,1612155349.0,2021,2021-01-31,Housing,Abby8989,0,l9v7yv

Lower credit score due to hacked credit card (Scotiabank),"A few years ago my credit card was hacked. I called Scotiabank as soon as I got their email about it being hacked and they canceled the card and sent me a new one. They assured me that the fraudulent transactions would be reversed and that I would not be required to pay them. I just found out that my credit score took a hit because of this. It seems like the fraudulent transactions were reversed after they were overdue and that screwed up my credit score. Can they legally do this? I did nothing wrong and always paid my bills on time. What can I do? Why am I getting punished for doing the right thing?

Edit: OK. if you're going to downvote me at least explain why.",4,1612155172.0,2021,2021-01-31,Credit,redditgirlwz,0,l9v68u
Insurance Policy for Retirement Income? Help me out pls.,"So 3 years ago a financial advisor buddy of mine talked me into this insurance policy with idea of using it for a supplemental retirement income with the added life insurance.  Up until recently I hadn't really taken my finances seriously but I'm trying to educate myself and get my shit together rather then blindly trusting other peoples advice.

I'm a 34yr old man with a 100k/yr professional in demand job.  Money wasn't an issue until I recently went through divorce and am basically starting from scratch.  I have a young son, no house, no partner.  I recently found out I will have an early inheritance of 100k to use as a down-payment on a house which I plan to use within the next year or 2 if I can.  I have only 10k in a tfsa which I'm investing and about 25k in student loans.

The insurance policy has a premium of $5555/yr for 20yrs at which point it will have a paid up life insurance of 273k and a cash value of 81.6k which continues to grow (25yrs - 97.6k, 30yrs - 114k, 35yrs - 131k, 40yrs - 152k etc).  My question is should I get out of this policy now and just put it towards my tfsa/rsp or stick with it?

I appreciate any advice.",3,1612154915.0,2021,2021-01-31,Insurance,Strathcona87,0,l9v3m3

Mortgage approval : last year income or current year income.,"  

&#x200B;

Ok guys so I had a quick question regarding income for getting a mortgage. 

Here’s my situation:

\-**Me** :

*Year 2019* : 86K

*Year 2020*: will probably be around 79K (due to covid, didn’t work for about 5 to 6 months – so I was on that 2000$/month - federal government money)

\-**Wife**:

Year 2019: 48K (was on maternity leave –been working with the same employer for the past 4yr)

Year 2020 : 35k or less, as she took 1 extra year leave at work, to stay home with the baby as the daycare was not available when she wanted to go back to work in march 2020- yes she was also granted the federal 2000$ for a couple of months I think.

Now, I went back to work full time and got a promotion by November 2020, and now makin about 104 000$ and the wife is goin’ back to work full time (March 2021) and will be makin’ about 48K (her regular salary – works for the government), may be more. 

We are thinkin’ to apply for a mortgage by June 2021 so that she can accumulate a few paystubs just in case the banks asks for the last 3 months work income.

We have accumulated 35k for this and I was thinkin’ to put down 25K (5%) and use the extra cash for closing cost. We are lookin for something around 500K or less ( we’re currently located in Quebec, and was think to buy something at about 30min to 1hr travel distance to Montreal, where we both work)

Now my question: is the mortgage amount based on our last year and previous year’s T4 or is it based on what we are currently makin now.

For example, my take home after taxes is 5,800$ and my wife’s will be 2,460$ = 8260$ this year. Are they goin’ to consider what we are makin now or will they consider our salary last’s year.

I was just thinkin’ if it’s good idea to apply this year or wait it out next year when we’ll get our T4 as a proof that our new income is different now (pre-covid march 2020 and after covif -  sept 2020).

Oh yeah, both of our credit is in good shape, im at 745 and she’s at 721. No debt, car payment 468$ a month. No credit card debt so far.

Apply in July or wait next year, after the tax season (April 2022) ?

Thank you.",2,1612154458.0,2021,2021-01-31,,davidokongo,1,l9uywt

How I paid $450K over asking price on a home and my Real Estate Agent Experience,"Before I start this post, yes I realize I’m an idiot and that my whole house searching process was rushed. I know that I should have done more research in the surrounding areas, and I should have stuck with my gut. I want to share my experience with my realtor in hopes that a new home buyer can catch the red flags that I so blatantly missed. I’m ashamed of myself, and I feel like I have put a huge burden on my wife and I, who are now struggling to get by. This is my experience of buying a home in Ontario, which closed on December 11th, 2020 and I’m hoping someone can learn from my mistakes and make more informed decisions. I apologize for the long rant, but I need to get this off my chest.

My wife and I are in our early 30s. We have decent jobs with a combined income of approximately $230K before taxes. We bought our first condo in 2016, which I paid for on my own as my wife was still in school at the time. I saved up every penny I could, and made a lot of social sacrifices. We’ve lived in that condo for nearly 5 years, and loved it. We knew that we would want to eventually start a family so we decided to upgrade to a new house in 2020.

Our previous realtor who helped us find the condo was no longer in the industry, so we found our new realtor on Facebook through a community group, who I will refer to as Daniel. He met us at our condo with his partner who I will refer to as Tom, and we explained our goals and what we wanted achieve. Originally, our goal was to sell our condo first and use the equity gained as a down payment for our new home. Daniel suggested that we go the opposite route by looking for a house first, and setting a closing date of 3 months in which we would sell our condo during that time. Tom provided a bunch of listings of Unit’s that sold within the last year so we had a pretty good idea of what to list it at. Daniel “guaranteed” we would be able to sell our Condo within 3 months. Spoiler alert, we weren’t able to sell because of the pandemic. This advice should have been the first red flag for me.

During a period of approximately 2 months, we visited over a dozen houses and even put a few offers on some. In the beginning, it appeared he had our best interest and provided advice on what to look out for, how much we should look at paying, when to back out etc. I honestly felt he was looking out for us. We couldn’t find the house we wanted, so I decided to go back to my original plan and list the condo first. We listed our unit for close to three months, and we didn’t get any offers. Our hopes of buying a home in 2020 didn’t seem possible.

Daniel suggested that we should talk to our current mortgage lender about refinancing, which I didn’t know about (Daniel was a banker for \~10 years dealing with mortgages before becoming a realtor). My wife and I looked into this, had our condo appraised, and what do you know, we were approved for refinancing and it looked like we had enough for a down payment. Our house hunt continued until we found something we really liked In late October, that was under our budget. We were ecstatic and wanted to visit the house right away. Everything looked amazing and my wife and I decided to go home and talk it over before we made an offer.

Before we wanted to make an offer, I had a few questions about the home that I saw in the photos, that I didn’t notice during our visit mainly due to the snow. There was something in the corner of the backyard, and Tom told us this was a fire pit. I also asked Daniel what was the average utility cost for a house in that area and he told me it was $200 for gas, water, and electricity **combined.** Fast forward to today, it’s more like $200 each per utility, and that “fire pit” was actually a storm catch basin with an easement on the property. However, at the time I trusted him and decided to put in my offer.

I was told that there were 10 offers on the house, and in order to secure a second round bid, I’d have to start at **$350K** over asking. At the time, the house was under my budget and $350K would be close to my original budget. I decided to go for it. Later on, I’m woken up at 11:30pm by Daniel saying if I want the house, I need to up my offer by another **100K.** At this point, my wife and I are barely awake but my original question to him was “That seems way over valued compared to other homes”. His response was “They’ve done upgrades to the place. Let’s just put in the extra 100K, and if they don’t accept we move on”. Guess what? They accepted, which he absolutely knew they would. To top it off, the only time I could have pulled out was at 12AM that same day, so essentially I had under 30 min to back out if I wanted. I was now contractually locked in with no clause to get me out, which Daniel never told me about, not to mention the fact that Daniel and Tom told us we should close in 45 days instead of 90 days. All of this information was dumped on us when we were half asleep. Not only that, but they never provided surrounding house listings that sold like they did with the condo.

Now onto securing the second mortgage for the new home, Daniel had “all the connections” to help us secure a mortgage. Since Daniel was a mortgage banker for 10 years, and also provided his mortgage business card, he said we would have no issues securing a second mortgage. Wrong – there were two banks that refused to secure a mortgage for us because our high debt ratio due to the refinanced condo. But Daniel had a connection that would help us which he put us in contact with; let’s call her Angelica. She seemed to know everything about our situation and said that it would be no issues for us to secure a mortgage. I found out later that Angelica is Daniels **wife.** To this day, Daniel doesn’t know that I know Angelica is his wife.

I suspect Daniel pushed to close in 45 days because he knew I would have to use his wife to secure a mortgage. I tried to go with a different bank, but when the bank tried to appraise the house, the seller refused to let hem in, or provide them with any answers about the home. I was essentially stuck with only one bank at this point. Did Daniel play a role in this? Possibly, but I can't prove that.

Here we are today, with a new home which I like, but definitely not worth the price I paid. I looked at surrounding areas, and my home is the highest paid home in the neighborhood. Daniel played us for fools, and he won in the end. Someone I thought I could trust ended up taking advantage of us and ultimately paid higher than any home in the area. One thing he said to me at the beginning of this whole process was “You two are AAA clients, any realtor would want you”. I now know what he meant by that.

To all new prospective home owners, please make sure you do your research and use a realtor that you know or someone you know that had success with. Research surrounding house prices, look at the renovations they did to see if the increase in value is justified. Do NOT rush home ownership.

I feel guilty everyday that I put my wife through such financial strain. I should have done more but now we have to see if we can make the most out of the situation that we are in. This will definitely test our relationship in years to come and I hope no one goes through what we did.

Any major disadvantages to listing your house for sale and taking it off if the offers do not meet your expectation?,"As mentioned in the title, I bought my house for a joke of a price last year in April when the housing market briefly panicked for a month. The price increase since then has been absolutely ridiculous since I got it.

On my street there are houses which are exactly the same build as mine, and one of them sold for 200k over what I paid for mine last month (checked on housesigma) and the owner told me he got 90 offers on his in 1 week. But this January, I am noticing things are hitting a different kind of crazy.

In short, I have decided to list mine. But I have a number in my head that will make sense to sell mine at given my mortgage penalty and realtor fees. But if the offers do not meet my expectation, is there anything wrong in removing the listing?",2,1612150383.0,2021,2021-01-31,,18borat,0,l9tqiv

Random Questions From A Beginner,"Hello all,

I’ve recently been looking into investing in the stock market and I’ve been doing some research. There’s some questions I still have that I either can’t find the answer to or am having a hard time understanding. If you guys could answer them in the simplest way possible that’d be great. 

- How do taxes work with Canadian/American stocks, dividends, etc and does it differ for holding long-term vs day trading?

- How do you keep track of all the stocks you’ve bought and what you paid/sold them for?

- Are there any advantages to opening up a TFSA in Wealthsimple compared to at my bank or vice versa?

- Are there any penalties on Wealthsimple if I were to be inactive on it in terms of investing in stocks and stuff?

- I’m mainly looking to invest long-term and I’ve been looking at the Canadian Couch Potato method. How exactly does buying stocks/Etfs/Index funds work in a TFSA and what’s the best stuff to invest in for the CCP method? 

- I’m currently in school with a bit of student debt that 
I’ll have to pay back, and I’m hoping to eventually buy a car. I usually get a full-time job during the summer as well.

30 year old young professional looking for some financial planning advice,"Hello PFC! I have been thinking lately as to what are other ways I can grow my money. Below you'll find a summary of my background and assets. Looking forward to hearing all your ideas. 

\- 30 year old male living in western Canada in a city where the cost of living is very affordable (Saskatoon). Single and no dependents.   
\- I hold two graduate professional degrees. I paid cash for both and have zero student debt.   
\- My salary is pretty low right now ($70k). I use to make 100k, but I had to take a paycut because of career change.  I am expecting it to go up to around $110-$120k for the next 2-3 years and then maybe 130-150K after.   
\- I currently have $80,000 saved up in cash.

\- I have two credit cards and have always paid the owing balance in full and on time.  I use the credit cards for everything, and have accumulated a few thousand dollars worth of travel points. I redeem these points so I can go on vacation.

\- I own a startup which is currently in research and development phase. I've secured $50k in government grant funding and will be going after another $25k over the next few months. I will be taking a portion as a salary for myself.

  
I own two condos:   
 \- $185,000 (20% down when purchased. I have had it rented it out consistently for the last 6.5 years. $113,909.28 principal balance remaining) .  
\- $230,000 (20% down when purchased. Its a 2 bedroom and I've rented the other room out for the last 5 years). Current balance owing is  $167,190.77. 

\- There was a time when I'd sleep in the small den (size of a laundry room) and rent out the two rooms.  I did this for 5 months. I would never wish this on anyone.. but I guess I saved a lot of money. 

RRSP:  
\- My previous employer had a killer RRSP where they would double match. I didnt really understand how this all worked (as I was 24 years old when I started), but many of the senior coworkers had mentioned that this was a huge reason as to why they took the job). I have around $63,000 in it currently with Manulife. 

\- I paid cash for my new vehicle in 2015 and have kept it ever since ($27k when purchased in 2015, and worth 11K now). I would like to buy a used vehicle (maybe a 2020 luxury or EV vehicle) near the end of 2021. 

Other investments: 

Stocks: I've lost a ton. So I'd rather not get into this as I've learned my lesson. But I currently have around $20,000 in my TFSA direct investing account. It's probably worth $32k-35K.",6,1612139075.0,2021,2021-01-31,Investing,cdn_canuck_1985,0,l9q5b7

My 2019 taxes were done by a consultancy company which was part of a package for living in the USA so they handled my split taxes.

In mid 2020 I moved back to Canada (citizen) and plan to continue that way for the foreseeable future. I've been doing my taxes my entire adult life but I'm not sure where to start with this split except to look at last years as a reference. I no longer have the support of this consultancy.

If it matters, I usually use SimpleTax and hope that it's possible to do so with this split year?

"When hiring a nanny, can I pay them as a 'contractor'?","We hired our nanny under the agreement she would be a 'contractor' and not an 'employee'. As such, she would be responsible for issuing us receipts and reporting her own income. We did this because we live rural and thought it would be an attractive option to be able to write off some of the mileage to get to our residence. We paid her the absolute top of our budget, under the assumption she would be paying more for CPP and doing the legwork. The nanny doesnt know how to report and I dont know where to direct her to find out. An accountant is too overwhelming to her. So I'm wondering if this is even an option for us or if we would be better off to reduce her pay (to cover the additional costs to us and stay wothin our means) and treat her as an 'employee'.",9,1612138217.0,2021,2021-01-31,,grumpeebadger,0,l9pv24

Exercising stock options for US company,"I started working as a contractor for a US company about 2 years ago (I've lived in Canada while working, Alberta recently). Part of the initial contract was an agreement for stock options where the strike price is $0.13USD/unit and 6000 shares total vested over 4 years. 3000 have now vested, and I'm being told the fair market value per unit is $27USD per share. Does that mean if I were to exercise my options now I would have to pay Canadian taxes on (27 x 3000) - (0.13 x 3000).

Seems pointless to buy these options now, as it would be a huge tax hit on the $81000. I'm not exactly sure how the fair market price was determined. This is a private company in the US with no Canadian presence at all. I was told this value by one of the financial employees.",2,1612137587.0,2021,2021-01-31,Taxes,michaeldeloreti,0,l9pn7i

S.A.F.E. in TFSA?,"I’m looking to invest in a round of financing involving a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) — through www.wefunder.com.

Can I do so inside my TFSA? Would the eventual conversion of that SAFE into preferred shares cause a tax event, or would those shares be considered tax-free investments inside the TFSA? i.e. Would the contribution limit used be the original cost of the SAFE, or the conversion valuation of the shares?

Trying to balance retirement planning and the possibility of home ownership - do I need a financial planner?,"I’m in my early forties and for the first time have some financial stability, just becoming indeterminate with the public service.  I spent my 20s and 30s doing low pay but fulfilling work overseas so this is my first time being in a position for long term financial planning. I’m hoping to own a house eventually (if I can afford it) but my main concern is not to screw up my retirement – I watched my parents mess up theirs with bad investments (facilitated in part by questionable financial advisors) and have little interest in repeating their mistakes. I likely fit somewhere near the cautious end of the financial planning spectrum.

For me, I’ve three years with the public service and currently making $85K now but will increase ~$3K/yr until I reach $105K.  I’d like to retire at 66 (25 yrs service) but could go a few more years if I had to; I enjoy my job. 

I’m debt free, $65K in savings/chequing, another $25K owed to me by family that I'm reasonably confident will be paid back in the next 5 years, and an older car I might have to replace in the near future.  I’m single, renting for $1500/month, and live fairly frugally (added >$40K to savings in last two years). The list prices of “move-in ready” houses that meets my needs in my area are $500K-$550K, but I’m told they’re often selling for 10% to 15% above appraisal right now. I could go the “sweat equity” route within reason ($450K-$500K). 

I need advice on how much house I can actually afford (e.g. can I retire before the house is paid for?), how much should I be devoting to savings/investing to supplement my pension now and in future, etc. 

Do I need a (fee-based?) financial planner to answer these questions for me and what kind of fees can I expect? I’m not an idiot but I also don’t consider myself financially savvy. I’m trying to improve that, but it’s turning into a slow process with a fair amount of uncertainty. 

Any advice welcome, thanks!",3,1612135640.0,2021,2021-01-31,,secretly_a_marmoset,2,l9p08n
Advisor/consultant on mortgage options,"Hey all,

I’m getting a mortgage soon and I have several options available
- mortgage directly with a bank
- home equity line mixed with a fixed portion with my bank which sounds interesting too
- mortgage through an independent broker (which truthfully is giving me worse rates than the bank directly).

I feel like it’s an important decision which has compounding consequences if i make mistakes.  I also feel like all professionals have some vested interest in selling me their option.

I’m thinking it’d be worth getting advice from an independent person who understands all options, but has no financial incentive to push me in any particular direction (other than a rate I’d pay them for their time and opinion).

Has anyone done that? Would you recommend it or anyone ?

TD E-series vs Wealthsimple,"I'been getting really interested in personal finance for the past year partly thanks to this sub and have been doing quite a bit of research on different topics including investing. I would like to start investing but can't decide if I should do it with TD E-series or through roboadvisors like Wealthsimple. I have all my stuff with TD so I thought it might be easier to invest through them as a start, but then I also read that you can only do it through TDDI now and I'm not sure if it's a downside, so would appreciate some insight guys

A little bit about me, I'm a 24M currently doing my MSc, have a decent emergency fund, and no debts. I'm also quite careful with my spending. Since my income is relatively low right now (mostly stipend), I'm looking to get my foot in the door/make it a habit and actually start contriubitng more once I'm employed eventually. I would want to invest mainly in index funds - something broadly diversified (maybe a mix of total US, Canadian and International & bond index funds or something similar) and have an asset allocation of around 60-70% stock 40-30% bonds. 

I would really appreciate some feedback on which platform to go with/any other advice and sorry if this post is a bit redundant, I just couldnt get myself fully settled on either of the two after looking at other posts on this subject.

Before anyone asks, I barely have 50k net worth. I'm new to the PF world and just trying to expand my knowledge. To ask the question in my title, is an investment of 10k not the same as 1M?

My limited knowledge led me to think a simple investment strategy like the CCP portfolio would work at $10k or 1M..At what point would someone be better off seeking advice from a professional? I have also read on this sub and claims about warren buffet saying the lazy strategy is the best.  The user in the linked thread also said:  


**"" Hedge positions with options, use more complex instruments that have defined outcomes, rotate bond funds based on how their duration responds to yield changes, research municipal bonds that are fed tax free for certain tax brackets. ""**  


I have no idea what any of those means, does it apply to Canadian tax/investing as well? If so, what book would you recommend to learn about these?

RRSP Over contribution advice,"I found out that I have over-contributed to my RRSP account by about $30k of post-tax income because I wasn't diligent about keeping all of my taxes and planning in good shape (fixing that now). 

My tax guy has told me to stop contributing, including employer matched contributions, but I'm waiting for him to tell me what we need to do next (and it's not coming too quickly)

Considering that the $30k over contribution was made with income after tax, am I able to just stop contributing now and claim the deduction in 2021 when I have room again, instead of worrying about withdrawing that amount back out of my RRSP?

My wife also has a ton of room to contribute to her RRSPs which I plan to focus the investing in for the next year. (we essentially just piled all of our contributions into my individual account, instead of splitting it across accounts in each of our names).

Transferring an RPP to an RRSP ?,"Hello! I am cleaning up my finances a bit and have an RPP at manulife. I would like to transfer out this account and self-invest it. I've done some googling, and it appears as though I would be able to transfer the account to an RRSP? Would this impact for contribution room at all? It also appears as though a portion of this account may be locked in and I would have to transfer this to a LIRA? I've been searching on the manulife website to determine the amount, if any, but haven't been able to find it. Does anyone have experience on where this would be?

If it makes a difference, I believe that the account was originally an RRSP and then change to an RPP when I left the employer. At the time I thought that it would be good to leave the funds there, but after a few years and the terrible returns (less than inflation over 5 years) I want to move it out. Hopefully I didn't shoot myself in the foot by not doing this right away....

If anyone has an recommendations on where to move the funds that would be great! I contacted wealthsimple and they said that I wouldn't be able to transfer it to them, but not sure if I worded the question correctly.

Roe headaches.,"So in March 2020 my company closed due to the general managers mother(the owner) died leaving no instructions for the business. He went and opened another company under a similar name. I chased him for weeks for my roe, weeks became months, turning into a phone call from service Canada asking about it. I then told him that they requested it to be submitted immediately. In between the old company closing and the new one opening I received regular benefits, which at the time was CERB.  New company opens and I’m back to work full time. Roe never gets submitted. Fast forward to June, I end up sick and in isolation for 2 weeks, not positive for covid but influenza. I then open a claim for verb again, I assume this was under the same claim. Fast forward to today, our business has taken a serious downturn. My boss has serious mental health problems as well as a drinking problem. Im not into a locksmithing apprenticeship with him and doing school part time. Because of the downturn in business I’m once again out on my ass, submitted a shortage of work claim last week when my last day worked was the 2nd. HE HAS STILL YET TO SUBMIT AND ROE. He hasn’t reimbursed for business expenses and I haven’t collected a pay check since the end of December and there hasn’t been any EI money as they’re waiting on roes.

New investor advice,"Hi there,

My husband and I (32 and 30) are looking to start investing in ETFs and would love some insight

Some background, we make around $180k pre-tax. We both pay into OMERS. We have two children ages 1 and 3 and put $5200 into RESP yearly to maximize government contribution. Our only debt is our mortgage which we are on track to pay off in 10 years. We have been slowly renovating our home as savings allow and plan to save around $30k/year over the next few years to finance our renos (house probably needs another 100k to finish it)

We currently have about $30k worth of CIBC Balanced Index fund in TFSA (1.2% MER) which we want to sell to invest in ETFs. We plan on investing an additional $10k/year at this point. 

We would love to retire by 55 so we have approx 25 year window.

We have been doing a lot of research and I have been looking into asset allocation funds. We have lots of TFSA contribution room. The only money we contribute to our RRSP is to repay HBP.

We moved our TFSAs and RESP to CIBC Investor Edge. Does it make sense for us to purchase one asset allocation fund in his TFSA and for me to purchase a different one in mine? Or should they both be the same? We are thinking either VEQT or VGRO - but also interested in the iShares equivalent. How did you choose between Vanguard or iShares?

Tangerine Deposit Bank Draft Deposit,"Hey all,

Life insurance question,"Hey all,

I’m currently thinking about life insurance policies to ensure that my partner can take care of himself and my debts if the unthinkable and unfortunate were to happen. I’m 29, don’t smoke and have no significant health concerns. 

I have $125k on a professional student LOC and $40k in government student loans. Right now, my LOC is insured with life protection for about $30 a month but that’s all the insurance that I have. 

I’ve recently discovered that a $500k life insurance policy is only about $40 per month. To me, it makes sense to cancel the life insurance policy on my LOC (which only protects the $125k balance) and to spend the extra $10 a month to get the $500 policy. For the extra $10 a month, the coverage is over 3x the amount of the LOC protection so this feels like a no-brainer to me. 

Can anyone tell me if I’m missing anything here that I should be considering in making this decision? Or does this sound like a sound plan?

Also would love to hear any recommendations for a company to go with re the life insurance policy! Right now I’m considering Manulife or RBC. 

Thanks everyone!",8,1612124609.0,2021,2021-01-31,,Recent_grad_2020TO,2,l9l2dr
Moving from Canada to Australia. Need some advice!,"  Hello all!

I have just accepted a position with an Australian company and my wife and I will be moving down under from Canada in the next few months. We will be on a TSS visa sponsored by the company. I will be heading down first with my wife to follow in the fall with our puppy.

I have been doing some research on what I need to do financially to complete this move and have run across several questions I'm hoping you can all help with.

Canadian RRSPs:  
 From my understanding I can and plan to leave these invested in Canada with no issues for the time being. They will be invested in VEQT.

I do have available contribution room and am potentially looking at stuffing this full before I leave. Still looking at the options here.

Tax:

I am still working in Canada for the time being while the visa and flights all get sorted.

I will have both Canadian and Australian income in 2021. I will have to file tax returns in both countries. I assume only Canadian income in Canada and Australian income in Australia. Is there any reason to believe I would be double taxed on my income in either country? I will let the CRA know that I am no longer a resident when that date is clear. Is there anything else I need to do to ensure I have a clean break in this regard?

Moving Cash Into Australia:  
 What is the best way to move CAD from Canada into Australia. Not all at once but probably all of it within the first 6-8 months. Looking to move quite a bit cash so something very safe, secure and low cost.

Bank Accounts:

We currently have a BMO joint chequing account, EQ Bank accounts for short term savings and emergency fund. We are planning on leaving the chequing account with the minimum dollar amount to maintain some entity here in Canada. Is this a reasonable thing to do? We would at some point make trips back to Canada and having some cash on hand would be useful. If we were ever to move back to Canada would having done this be beneficial? Everything in the EQ accounts will be moved to Australia at some point as mentioned above.

Credit Cards and Credit Score:

We each have 2 credit cards. I was planning to cancel the newest ones (least amount of credit history) and reduce the other cards to no fee ones in order to maintain that credit history.

Does this matter if we were ever to come back? If we cancelled everything would we have to rebuild our credit history in Canada if we wanted to get approved for a mortgage?

TL;DR: Moving from Canada to Australia in the coming months. Looking for advice on taxes, RRSPs, closing bank accounts, and maintaining some credit history. If you think there's something else I should be considering please let me know!",7,1612124350.0,2021,2021-01-31,,TheRomanianMiner,0,l9kys6

"What's the ""just don't live in Toronto"" crowd saying now?","For years on PFC, people would complain about high housing costs in Toronto. ""Well you have to think bigger than just Toronto, move further out!"" people would reply. ""If you're only looking in Toronto then yes you're out of luck.""

Unauthorized transaction on my Tangerine credit card,"So, about one hour back, I received a notification that an iPhone was purchased using my credit card. While my wife had been asking for one for 2 years, I have not purchased one yet. I immediately called up Tangerine, somehow reached to a service agent who transferred me to their security department. Security department did some verification and assured me that the card has been cancelled and a new one will be sent. Did a quick check and nothing else seems suspicious.

Did I dodge a bullet? Remains to be seen. However, it came as a shock and not everything is alright. I have to change credit cards for all my bills and subscriptions. I will not have my preferred card for next 2-3 weeks, plus some other possible hassles which I have yet to realized. There is time lost which cannot be compensated. I had committments for today which I could not fulfill. Overall a mental energy and time loss regardless of the financial losses.

Some learnings for me: always enable alerts for transactions. Monitor alerts periodically. Pause card immediately. Report any suspicious transactions 

I am disappointed in Tangerine. I expected them to be on cutting edge technology, but they lost my appreciation. They require a 4-6 digit PIN to login, just like my garage door. There is No 2FA. Even my Reddit account has stronger security. Other banks are not too better either. I have had cards from other banks in past, they too did not have any kind of 2FA. Why is Canada so behind on this? Other countries have solved this long ago.


PSD2/SCA in EU requires 2FA for credit card transactions.
India also requires  2FA.
In Canada, we are living in the 70s. Wake up!

Edit: it appears that several people were not aware of the 2FA I am talking about.

Investing for first time as dual US - Canada citizen,"Posting anonymously.

I'm an accidental American. Basically my family immigrated to Canada when I was a child and I didn't realize I had to file US taxes until recently.

I just got in touch with an accountant to do my US taxes and report my bank accounts to be compliant. I have no ties to the US, never worked a day in my life in the US and I consider myself fully Canadian.

I spent the majority of my life low income. I've only recently gotten my life together with a good job at 38 years old. I make $72,000 gross. My husband makes about $60,000 gross and we have a toddler.

Before that I was working mostly close to minimum wage before I decided to go back to school. It paid off. I made more in my co-op than I did in my job before going back to school.

We own a house with a mortgage of about $200,000. We have no other debt.

Now that I'm finally making some money I want to invest, but I did research that I should not have a TFSA. Since I didn't know anything about this before I do have a TFSA. I've had it since the government created the TFSA program. I have e-series index funds in it, it's worth about $40,000.

I have a lot of TFSA contribution room and only about $30,000 RRSP contribution room due to my low income for most of my life.

How should i invest to prepare for retirement? I'll be 40 years old this year. My husband is 34 years old. We have a 2 year old.

I work for the federal government, so I'll have a pension, but I also started late so I will not be able to get a full pension. I stared about 3 years ago 36. I do not want to work until I'm 71.

I know that the TFSA is usually the best account for investment purposes, but since I shouldn't use it due to the US taxing TFSA's as well as the expensive filling needed for it, how should I invest?

Should I fill up my contribution room in my RRSP? I'm worried that not paying as much in Canadian taxes will mean I'll owe US taxes. How much should I contribute to RRSP's and what should I invest in? VGRO or something?

I don't know much about investing.

We currently have a lot just sitting in chequing accounts, about $150,000. 

Should we pay off our mortgage since I can't invest in my TFSA?

Or should I invest in a taxable account?

Any advice would be appreciated!

Thanks!

How to transfer from EQ HISA to Wealthsimple Trading account?,"A little lost on how to transfer some funds in my EQ TFSA savings account  into my WS TFSA account for trading. (Also EQ TFSA savings has a 2.3% interest rate- the highest I’ve seen anywhere)

"Here's my budgeting template, just wanted to share in case anyone finds it useful!","Hi /r/PersonalFinanceCanada!

I just want to say that I'm a 22/yo from Ontario and have been a lurker / small poster for a while and I have learned so much from this sub and I'm extremely grateful!

I know that there are lots of templates out there but I just wanted to share mine as a lot of my friends found it helpful. I know I'm a little late ( end of January ) but hopefully, some of you may still find it useful.

Here's a [Link](https://imgur.com/a/ANaUuIK)
 to some pictures of the template. I randomized all the numbers but kept the transaction info there (that's why some of the parts are blocked off).

**The Sheet**

It's a modified version of the google sheets template that they give you for each month. I really liked the way that the google sheets template looked but I was annoyed that I had to make a new spreadsheet for each month and that I had to put in transactions through the sheet. So in this spreadsheet, I used a google form and combined all of the months into one tab of the google sheet. I also made a yearly overview that aggregates the monthly data and added other cool graphs and stats like % saved, % invested etc. Now every time I buy something I fill it out quickly on my phone and it gets saved to my google sheets (only takes 10 seconds).

**How to Install**

You can follow this [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/qgJAff4) tutorial

But basically, you follow these steps:

1. Open this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KsxnD8e0jwUABHXrpG0DX9tBLa0w-rIG
2. Make a copy of the google sheet ( ONLY SHEET NOT FORM )
3. The sheet + form should be in your own google drive now, Just create a folder for the two new files
4. Open the google form and press the send button. Share the link to your phone via text. 
5. Once open on your phone add a quick link to your home screen
6. Now you're done you can add new transactions from your phone when you buy stuff / get paid
7. Change the pink cells to match your own budget
8. More instructions on how to use the sheet / add categories is on the ""How to Use"" tab

**Notes**

* I'm not super good at excel and there may be some inefficiencies with the sheet. If you find any pls lmk and I will change it!
* The way the sheet is set up is that you have 1 bank account that everything flows through. This may not work for everyone but it works for me
* This kind of budgeting is very granular ( takes a look at each transaction ) and it may not work for everyone but it only takes 10-15 seconds to do so I recommend it! 
* On the google form, I wasn't able to make individual sections for Income / Expense / Investment categories because it messed with the spreadsheet a lot. If you know how to fix this pls lmk!
* Only edit cells highlighted in pink

Please let me know if there's anything I should add or if you have any questions! Thanks again for being such a great community!

Edit: There may be an issue with the Month on the Transaction tab not populating properly. I have no idea why its doing that but just make sure you have this formula in Cell B2 of the Transaction Tab on the Google sheet:

=ARRAYFORMULA(if(ISBLANK(A2:A),"""",Month(A2:A)))

Will my credit score plummet once I graduate?,"I've been using my Scotiabank Student Visa Card since my first year of University and I'm graduating next year. I'm worried that since I've never worked before and have no employment income at all, once I graduate, they will not automatically renew my Visa Card or change it to a regular one since I won't meet credit card requirements. Also, by losing this student visa card, wouldn't that change the length of my credit history, thereby lowering it?

Down Payment Question,"This is cross posted. 

Down-payment Question

Hi everyone! Super (probably dumb) question. Back story possibly required. 

Partner and I bought a condo five years ago. We refinanced our mortgage last year (crazy low interest) but our condo, regardless, has been losing crazy value. We are presented with an opportunity to build a house. Giving us about 5-6 months to save a down payment, which wasn’t our plan for a few years. Out mortgage broker is also giving us 12,000 (not tied to our mortgage, it’s like a bonus) to be used to pay debt upon moving in. 

Here’s dilemma. We can maybe save 7k between now and then. We could, theoretically, take the remaining 13 on our line of credit and use the 12k to pay that back off. Alternatively we could borrow from my family, but I’d prefer not to have to do that.

I started off with a monthly direct transfer and have made a few lump sum deposits, but due to a few factors including reduced expenses and a recent raise I currently have:
$15k in TFSA
$10k in savings 
$4k in chequing account

I am 29 and have never had substantial savings before in my life so I have no idea what to do with them! I’m not originally from Canada and am not sure if I’ll stay long-term so I’m not really interested in an RRSP for now (my work doesn’t match it or anything and I figure it would be a pain to deal with if I move back home in a few years).

1. Is there any point in keeping $10k in my regular savings account? I would prefer to have a few thousand dollars “running away money” somewhere accessible but definitely wouldn’t need to be this much.
2. I have only recently realized that most people invest their TFSA’s instead of just letting it sit there - if I go to someone at my bank for advice, will they be impartial or am I better off finding somebody else? 
3 (Bonus question): All my banking is with CIBC currently so I keep a minimum of $3k in the current account to avoid a $15 fee. Is it worth switching to a no-fee bank like Tangerine to avoid having to do this? I’ve been with CIBC since I moved here and had free fees for 2 years so it’s honestly probably laziness/familiarity more than anything else that I’m still with them.",6,1612112591.0,2021,2021-01-31,Banking,Aleecheemo,1,l9ghhh

Should I sell my Oshawa house and downtown Toronto condo to purchase a Toronto house,"Posting here instead of real estate board as I’m hoping to get some sound advice. 

According to Zolo statistics Toronto housing prices are down while Oshawa prices are on the rise? I’m really trying to wrap my head around this. I’m assuming that this is because of working remotely and people are moving out of Toronto? But they can’t all be moving to Oshawa? Or could it be due to the drastic decline of condo prices in Toronto while Oshawa is mainly houses and in reality houses in general are going up.

Could you guys also help me with the decision if I should sell my Oshawa house (possibly at a loss, I didn’t have experience and overpaid) and my condo (slight gain but not much) in downtown Toronto to purchase a house in Toronto right now? Is this a terrible idea during this time? 

I have another 2 condos in Toronto although not downtown that I could also possibly sell in some sort of combination but both would be at a loss since I was stupid and purchased them last year (at a pretty significant loss). I would strongly prefer not to touch these but I’m only mentioning them because should I hang on to my downtown condo since this is a safe bet for additional growth? Also should I hang on to the Oshawa house since Oshawa pricing seems to be on the rise? I would prefer to get rid of this one since I’m currently renting it out at a significant loss and the renters are trashing the place. My mentality is also I want to try to recuperate what I can from the house since I bought it so high. Also I’m almost certain I will not settle in Oshawa in the future (at the time in 2017 prices were crazy and I freaked and just wanted to secure a house in close proximity to Toronto).

How many years into the future can I deduct an RRSP contribution made today?,"(For the purposes of this discussion let's assume that my TFSA is maxed out and out of the picture)

From reading [this page](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/rrsps-related-plans/contributing-a-rrsp-prpp/what-unused-rrsp-prpp-contributions.html), if I make an RRSP contribution eligible for 2020, I only need to fill out Schedule 7. After that I can claim the deduction (aka tax credits) for it in any tax year of the future.

Bob does this and finds he has a 25k tax return which he was thinking about adding into his RRSP for 2021. his contribution room is now at 10k plus 

* 18% of your earned income in the previous year
* the annual RRSP limit (for 2020, the annual limit is $27,230)

"Retirement, should I stick with the defined benefits pension or cash out? Things to consider?","I live in Ontario Canada and am 57 years old and will be retiring this spring after a 35 year career.  Its coming time to select my retirement option which is to either take a defined benefit pension or terminate & pull out all of my pension money (commute).  Not sure which way to go and want to be sure I've considered all of the pros/cons of each option.  Here's what I know............

**Defined Benefit from a secure pension fund:**

\- $100k per year (drops to $67k upon my death so my wife still has an income).

\- Pension is indexed with the cost of living

\- Full health & dental benefits (wife still gets them even upon my death).

**Terminate (Commute) Pension:**

\- Receive $980k for a LIRA plus $1.2M cash (after taxes)

\- Full health & dental benefits but this ends for my wife after my death

Other info is that my wife is also 57, retired and has a $150k in RRSP's and a $150k LIRA but no other pension or benefits.  No other household debt.

I realize that with the termination option there may be potentially more money in the estate for our adult children upon both of our deaths (which we feel is a good thing) but we may also be living on our last penny if we make it to 90 and burn through the funds.  The obvious risk is what guaranteed return is needed if we invest the money and live off the interest while drawing down the principal over an extended period of time.  I estimated this at 30 - 35 years (using a very conservative % return) but it would also be nice to leave something behind for the kids & grandkids.  We have a very low risk tolerance in our current investment portfolio and wouldn't feel comfortable investing any other way.

Need advice as a first time property investor. Please help.,"Hi PFC,

I grew up in a very poor family where my parents immigrated to Canada and worked minimum wage jobs to support my sister and I. I studied my ass off with the intention of eventually giving back to my family. Fast forward to today, I work in a job that pays \~120K and my wife owns her own business that makes roughly the same or more. We are very frugal, and saved every penny we had to buy property given the housing crisis we are in.

I bought a condo in 2016 and lived there for 4 years at \~$390,000. My intention was to sell the condo, and upgrade to a larger home. The market value was \~$600k, but I had listed it for less, but because of Covid, I wasn't able to sell. From the advice of my realtor and the banks, we refinanced the condo in order for me to get the enough for the downpayment for our new home. I bought a house large enough for me and my wife, future kid, and for my parents because I wanted to get them out of the shithole their living in now. So now, I have two properties: My primary residence being my house, and the condo, which my sister is now renting from me.

I wanted to sell the condo this year and give half of what I make in profits to my sister in order for him to make his first property purchase, while the other half would go into my mortgage. I just learned today, by stumbling on another post, that I have to pay **capital gains tax of up to 50%** when I sell my condo. I had no idea that I had to do this, and the banks or my realtor never told me this (Why would they? Their just trying to make money off me).

We're barely getting by and selling this condo and donating half the profit to my sister for her future home was always my plan, while I use the rest to pay off my mortgage as quick as possible. I'm not trying to get rich selling this property, I'm trying to help my family get by through this ridiculous housing crisis were all facing.

Is there anything I can do, or do I accept the fact that I will not be able to help my sister out. I have no idea what to do. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

QUOTE  
 Various government securities acts spell out the responsibilities of  “advisers” to their clients. Meanwhile, the investment industry commonly  calls their salespersons “financial advisors” even if they are not  registered to act as advisors. At the Small Investor Protection  Association (SIPA), we have seen a danger to investors in placing their  trust and savings with sales people instead of advisors who have a  fiduciary responsibility to act in their client’s interests.

A few years ago the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA)  confirmed to SIPA that “financial advisor” is an “unregulated business  title” that can be used by anyone. Then why was it so difficult for  small investors to learn this?

Regulators rightly stress the importance of checking to see that your  financial advisor is registered. But it’s not enough to be registered,  it’s important to see what they are actually registered to do. SIPA  investigated the directories of registered representatives. We found  that about [96% are registered](http://www.sipa.ca/library/SIPAsubmissions/500_SIPA_REPORT_REGISTRATION-Above-the-Law_201611.pdf) as a “dealing representative” which is a salesperson without a requirement to look after a client’s best interests.

SIPA’s detailed search on the CSA website discovered there are only  **4,076** persons in all of Canada registered in the categories where a true  fiduciary, professional responsibility is legally required to be  delivered to you as the investor. This means they must act solely in the  client’s best interests.

But there are a whopping **118,126 financial salespeople**, or dealing  representatives, in Canada. Some may have little or no education, skill  or proficiency beyond their dealer and product pusher training, to give  you any worthwhile advice. They are registered to give you only  “suitable” advice.",9,1612087168.0,2021,2021-01-31,,Erminger,9,l99eqs

TFSA and how to use it?,"Hi All,

I recently opened a TFSA account and have a few questions about how to actually use it. TFSA accounts are foreign to me as I moved from Australia to Canada around \~1.5 years ago.

I opened an account with BMO and deposited $6,000. From what I understand, this is the yearly maximum contribution amount? or could I have contributed more for the first initial deposit?

Ultimately, I'm trying to figure out how to use this account to actually purchase an ETF (BMO offered ETF, ZCLN). I'm assuming I have to also open a trading account with BMO to then purchase the ETF (hopefully using the money deposited in the TFSA). 

Thanks for any help anyone can offer!",17,1612074355.0,2021,2021-01-31,,saddybedangdang,2,l96gla

25yo grad student just getting into investing,"Hi all, only recently joined but I dig the community here!

I'm currently completing my MA in Vancouver, I decided to do grad school because it would be guaranteed employment for a couple years to ride out the COVID job market and come out with extra qualifications. 

I'm living with relatively few expenses, as I live with my parents for really cheap rent, and the fellowships I receive as part of my MA funding cover my tuition and then some. Admittedly I've got a couple lifestyle expenses I need to curb, but overall I'm breaking even each month.

I have about $30k in student loan debt, but I'm also sitting on about $16k saved up from various sources. All this news about short squeezes and gamestonks has caught my ear, and while I don't plan on dropping everything on $GME for the memes, I am looking to take the savings and throw them around a bit at some safe investments to help grow my money, tackle my loan debt, and start a nest egg for when I'm older. I've done a bit of research but this whole business is just so daunting.

I'm looking to put a bit in some relatively safe stocks and ride on dividends from that, and perhaps also look into GICs if they're worth it. I want to be safe and protect my investment but I also have a little bit I'm willing to yolo with. I've started using WealthSimple and put some money on that (haven't traded at all yet) and I'm also thinking of opening RBC Direct Investments.

I guess what I'm asking is: what are some safe investments that I can make that will work for me given my circumstances?

Should I save tuition tax credits for when I graduate?,"Hello everyone,

I'm an international student in Newfoundland studying computer engineering since 2019 and plan to settle in Canada after I graduate - I do an internship every year and when I file my taxes I use the T2202A tuition credits (I had 6263$ claimable last year) and will keep getting these credits each year. 

My question is - is there an advantage to using them when I have a full time job after I graduate vs. just using them now? I found [this](https://www.taxchopper.ca/tips/TuitionTransfer.jsp) link saying on point 3 that it is calculated against the lowest federal tax rate. Since my tax rate would be higher after I graduate wouldn't that allow me to get a higher deduction?

Need some advice on some debt my wife and I need to pay off.,"So let me start by saying, things are turning around for my wife and I, I'm 32, A Journeyman Electrician, I make around 115k/yr just working my regular 40/wk and my Wife 32, just graduated as an LPN and it's making around $26/hr working 32 hours a week. 

I have around 11k in debt that I've been hammering off, 26k in savings, and 34k in an rrsp. 

My wife has around 40k in debt from school and spending money on stupid shit. She's definitely learned her lesson and has been hammering off hers as well.

I have the power to wipe everything clean and just start fresh by draining my savings and rrsp to pay everything off. We have no car payments, and after our mortgage payments and expenses we'd be able to save around $2000/mth with healthy spending cash after that.

Opinions on my current investment strategy?,"Hi r/PersonalFinanceCanada, 

I'm looking for some advice. I've recently started trading with Wealthsimple with some spare money and am really enjoying the platform, as well as the control over where my money is invested. With that being said, I don't plan on making this a full time habit or job where I have to focus daily on what's happening within the market. 

I'm currently invested in RBC Individual Investment Account (\~16k in Select Aggressive Growth Fund), RBC RRSP (\~17k in Select Balanced Fund), RBC TFSA (\~39k in Select Balanced Fund), Company Sponsored Pension Fund in private financial group (\~18k in Aggressive Growth Fund), as well as a rental property. I'm not actively putting a monthly amount in any of these accounts, I randomly add a large sum about once a year. I am going to try to make it a point to add slowly instead of one large sum when I remember. 

My concern right now is if staying with RBC is going to hinder my growth. At first I thought it would be wise to have my savings invested with professionals, but after two years with them I noticed that my returns aren't spectacular, and I'm just wondering if I would be better off using different brokerages or accounts to accelerate the growth.

"If you incorporate your side business, what level of detail do you need to keep?","Hi, I have a side online business. I am reaching a revenue amount that would make sense to incorporate instead of being an individual business. However, my business has hundreds of transactions monthly.

&#x200B;

For example, I make 6 sales a day. Each sale has 3 fees associated with it (marketing fee, payment processing fee, transaction fee). So I cannot keep a ledger myself because that would 4 micro transactions per sale, times 6 sales a day, times 30 days a month, to a year, but i can download the list of transactions from the online marketplace, and filter it to show me the total of each category (total of revenue, refunds, marketing fee, etc) per month.

&#x200B;

When a customer places an order (eg. 6 orders a day on avg), I make 6 orders to the suppliers and pay with my credit card, then supplier ships directly to customer. So I cannot make a list of all these 6 payments, and repeat daily, manually, but I can download my credit card statement which will show these amounts to the supplier name. I can also download a list of transactions from the supplier, which shows every single order, product, time, date, and cost.   However, this entire list is lumped into 1 payment in my credit card statement.  (This example is for a day in business, but these statements are usually generated per month, not per day).

So what I've been doing, is a simple excel sheet. I update it monthly. I use my credit card statement amount for purchases made to the supplier as the cost of goods sold, and I download a statement from the online marketplace which breaks down revenue, fees, refunds, etc per month, and I use these in my excel sheet too. I do have side expenses every now and then that I keep invoices for and add to my excel sheet.

&#x200B;

If I incorporate, is this enough? I was told to use an accounting software, which logs all transactions. However, I have to manually classify these transactions, and I have 100s of them that I cannot do manually. Therefore a general excel sheet that shows total numbers per month is what I use.  If somebody needed more info for a given month, I can product a detailed statement of transactions from the marketplace, a statement of transactions through my credit card, and statement of trasnactions with the supplier.

&#x200B;

But I don't have a single ledger that combines all these, and shows that X amount was transferred from my online marketplace to my bank account on this day, or out of my account and used as a refund, or from my account to pay for a service with a difference vendor etc, but rather an excel sheet that shows monthly numbers of expesnes and income, and i keep all bills/statements which show all the details separately.  So is this okay?",12,1612060972.0,2021,2021-01-30,,LibertyState,1,l92jty

Opinions on Sun Guaranteed Investment Funds,"My Dad recently passed away leaving me to help my mom with her investments. Neither of us are financial planners and it's a bit overwhelming on deciding what to do next when it comes to her retirement.

We have a financial advisor who's recommending she start to draw down her RRSP to reduce the tax burden upon her passing. He's suggesting taking her RRSP and splitting it into two, $150k and $150k, to be placed into Sun Life products. The first portion would go in to a 60/40 (equity/bonds) investment series which has a death benefit guarantee attached (something like 70% of the market value). Every year $20k would be taken out until this balance goes to $0.The other $150k would be put into an Income Series portfolio made up of bonds. It too has a death benefit guarantee and would be drawn down each year.

The money taken out each year would then be placed in an Estate Series portfolio cash account (set to 60/40) which has a death benefit guarantee, only in this case it's 100% of the market value. This benefit matches the highest amount of the previous year and during a downturn stays there until the market recovers. It keeps this  until age 80 at which point it stays fixed and no longer matches the market value.

The goal here is to reduce the tax paid by the estate on her death and to preserve capital. She doesn't require the money for daily expenses, nor does she have any plans for spending it - it would all go towards inheritance.

I understand that the fund and the advisor each take their cut by way of management fees which has a drag on performance, but are there any other downside?  The insurance portion is appealing, especially for someone who went through bad losses during the 80s and 90s. What do other people do when it comes to investing retirement savings and minimizing tax?

24yr old living at home looking for strategic financial advice!!,"Since the start of COVID I have taken some time reading about finance in attempts to stop being as reckless with my money as I have been most my life. Although I have made some steps in the right direction I feel as if my setup is not optimized. My main goal is to be able to purchase a house to move out instead of renting. After that I want to be able to build my self up financially in the most efficient way possible. My current setup is as follows:

I am a carpenter making about 50k a year 
My living expenses are about $1100 a month (car, rent, insurance, gas, phone,food) 

I have a neo max credit card in which I run most my expenses through to take advantage of the cash back rewards. I pay this off immediately and have always been super responsible with credit cards 

I have a $6500 line of credit debt through TD @ 7.99% interest in which I currently lower roughly $1200/month 

I have a TFSA investing account through TD in both American and Canadian which I opened about 5 months ago and instantly put all my TFSA savings account money into as I found the TFSA savings account sucked!

$2000 USD has grown to about $2500USD 
$6000CAD has Shrunk to about $5500CAD 
Since I started investing blindly and poorly educated on the market...

I have a TD mutual fund RSP under ‘medium to low risk’ in which $35 is auto deposited every month since I opened. This is at $400

I have about $600/month left in my budget after paying my bills and line of credit that I’d normally spend on stupid stuff like food or alcohol or video games but I’m exercising discipline and trying not to spend that all on fun.

I’m looking for advice on where I can put any extra saved money or any strategy to optimize my setup. For now it will go to my line of credit but where after? Should I have my money in other accounts. Is there any literature or forums that you recommend for learning more about investing and savings? The internet can be confusing and always seems to push there own products on me. The TD financial advisors only seemed to want to push there products on me and not what was the best interest for me.

Can anyone confirm this is correct? I probably should have just opened a Questrade account, which I likely will do at some point, but went with iTrade for the instant transfer from my existing Scotia accounts.",11,1612053972.0,2021,2021-01-30,Investing,cavedwlrr,0,l90big

RRSP vs TFSA? Which to prioritize?,"
Over the last couple of years, thanks to a lot of hard work and a bunch of luck, I've managed to increase my income substantially. I have a few income streams (employment & self-employed), and total gross should land between $110-125k this year (up from ~$40k in 2019).

I've paid off all debt, have a 6-month emergency fund, created sinking funds for larger upcoming (expected) expenses, and haven't otherwise increased my COL. 

Now I'm shifting focus to TFSA and RRSP. 
Contribution room: 
TFSA = $75,500
RRSP = $35,000. 

Which should I prioritize? I'll have between $30-40k to put into these investments this year, and want to make sure I’m smart about it.",11,1612052216.0,2021,2021-01-30,,Mindful-Flow,2,l8zqra

Sell or keep new-build rental that has 120k increase,"Hey all, I need some advice weighing my options. I bought a new-build townhouse condo in Ottawa in the summer of 2019, it’s set to close in June of this year and I’m trying to weigh my options. The builder has released new lots for the same model now goes for 120k more than I bought it for.

Hot Take - it’s irrational not to take on maximum debt to get in to Canadian housing in metropolitan areas,"There’s a stat that just came out, suburb houses are up almost 40% YoY in some areas. Assuming you put 10% down, that’s a 400% ROI (Without fees, surely i don’t need to add in fees to show the math works out well). Furthermore, all gains are TAX FREE.

Legitimately, you don’t even need to work with gains that good. On a 500k house, that’s an appreciation of 200k. You’re better off running a Brampton Loan, getting in to housing, staying unemployed, collecting generous government benefits and then selling to make more than the majority of middle class workers make after taxes. Anecdotally, I see this From lots of people that also have illegal basement apartments.

And the worst part is, ITS BEEN GOING ON LIKE THIS EVERY YEAR.

Why will the trend turn now? Housing has lower volatility than stocks, the government has nothing going for the economy other than housing RN.

By not getting in because you’re ’rational‘, you’re throwing away essentially guaranteed returns. I can pull up article after article from 2009 calling Toronto housing a bubble.

If you’re not getting in, you’re making a mistake.",37,1612050308.0,2021,2021-01-30,,rbatra91,0,l8z3bq

Confusion over real estate capital gain,"In August I moved to BC from Ontario to start a new job. At the time of my move I did not sell my house because I still needed to finish up a renovation and my partner was still living in it while we waited for him to find work in BC. This summer I plan to return to Ontario to finish the renovations and sell the house. I'll likely sell around August. The house has never been rented out or vacant. 

When I moved to BC I completed all the paperwork to become a BC resident. The reason I did this is because my son needed to enter school in bc. We have been living in an apartment. 

I am very confused about the implications of this for capital gains when I sell the house which is in my name.   I bought the house in the summer of 2016 and it has been my primary residence up until August 2020. When I sell at some point before August 2021, will I run into trouble with capital gains?  The plan is to buy a house in BC as soon as we can find one.

"Question for career tips, or if I'm way off base and not going to have any success with what I'm thinking.","Sorry if my post is rambling, or has any ""well obviously"" questions, but even getting that as a response at least makes it concrete in my overthinking mind...

Background on me, I worked in Fort McMurray for 7 years after highschool as a sales rep, didn't like sales excactly, (was rental equipment so I didn't really feel like I cared about what I was doing, so I only stayed on for the money and cause ppl were cool there, if it was something I cared about I'd have enjoyed it more). I never went to post secondary so I don't have a degree or really any certifications outside stuff like first aid etc. I've since moved to Edmonton and every job I've interviewed for I get rejected for the ""risk of me taking a higher paying job in the oilpatch"" even though I express my desire never to return there, or they're too far outside my practical experience for that concern to be overlooked. 

I was considering using the last of my CRB with some loaned money from my family to try to take a course to get something to get into the financial/business sector profrssionally. Working with my bosses on the company finance side was always interesting to me, and I've always had interest in investments or financial planning and that sort of thing. I'm not interested in sales of items, so no equipment or cars unless it was a stop gap to keep me afloat while I study for something better.

So the main part of my question now that you know a bit about the 25 year old nobody lol, would something like the CSC be able to help me get in the door with a bank or investment broker in Canada? Or will not having any degrees harpoon most of my chances from the get go?

Being a dumb kid making too much money in Fort Mac left me a good chunk in debt now a line of credit, so I doubt I'd qualify for any student loans to go to school full time. Something like the CSC cost is manageable but it only lasting 3 years without work has me hesitating in case it's a mistake and I'm overlooked for not having formal education in Finance or business, regardless of my 7 years experience working under my branch manager where I got a fair bit of practical experience, (which isn't very concrete to bank a job prospect on)

Thanks for anyone who takes the time to read this mess, thoughts are a bit scrambled as I'm in a pinch not with not finding work and I feel like I'm staring down the barrel of a gun if I don't do something to find work. (I recognize the CSC would take several months to do, but would do it if it meant I'd have at least the chance for interviews to try to land a job)",3,1612046309.0,2021,2021-01-30,Employment,AJ-Metz,2,l8xok2

"Should I buy gold before or after the ""next crash""? Where is the best / cheapest place to buy gold?","Everyone is talking about how the government is printing unprecedented amounts of money out of thin air lately. There are also talks about a market crash happening soon, and it might be as bad as the 1929 crash. There are ppl theorizing both significant inflation, but deflation also.

Right now, all of my money is sitting in a chequing account earning 0% interest. I have no other investments.

When we had the crash in march, I noticed that gold prices went down? Why is that? Will the gold prices go down again during the next crash, or will the inflation be so bad that gold will skyrocket? Should I rush to buy gold now, or wait until this crash and buy then? With all the money printing that's going on behind the scenes right now, how has gold remained steady since last August?

Lastly, where would be the cheapest place to buy genuine, good quality gold? I checked out TD bank, they are selling an ounce of gold for $2495 CAD. Using market rate conversion, this is equal to $1,953 USD, which is $109 greater than the spot price for an ounce of gold which is $1844.

We've considered the following:-The daycares we've looked at have all been around $2200-2400 per month from 9-5 in Toronto until our child hits 18 months old and it goes down a bit

\-Hiring a nanny from 8-6 appears to be about $3,000 a month (we have a dog so hopefully the nanny would be able to walk the dog as well)

\-We could both continue to work from home but that would have to be temporary until we are compelled to go back to the office

My understanding is there's tax breaks for childcare but I believe we would be ineligible (household income >$150k) so my real question is: is there any other options that people have found to be useful? Am I missing something obvious? Our parents work and have elderly parents themselves so we don't want to rely on them.

Wealthsimple income tax advice.,"
Hello, new to investing.

Opened a wealthsimple trading personal account. I put in a few hundred. I don't intend to sell. This is to slowly grow for longterm. This is a personal account. How do i report this for my income tax? If I did sell stocks from my personal portfolio, is that considered a business?

I did also open a TFSA on wealthsimple today. I have a small investment in that as well. 

For tax purposes I feel like I'm not as informed as I should be. Even if its a small portfolio there are still things that I need to know for taxes ( in Ontario) and for investing in the future.

Getting a Mortgage for Secondary Home/Investment Property,"Hello,

I'm looking to purchase a property and am hoping this subreddit could help answer certain questions I have about the terms of.  
I expect that the use of the property will be split between AirBnb and as a secondary vacation home (eg. Spend the summer there and AirBnb it in the winter).

My question, as part of the mortgage terms, we would need to state it it will be owner-occupied or rental. So what would this count as given the expected time split? Is there a set definition of what should be owner-occupied and what is a rental?

What if I list it as owner-occupied but have it listed on AirBnb when it is vacant just to earn extra income on the side? What are the implications if the lender finds out that it was rented for a fair amount of time during the year?

Hoping someone can maybe shed some light to this.

What to do with extra income?,"Hey guys, I wanted to know what would be best when it comes to taxes and my situation. After having worked in that domain, I started a small job in fall of last year where I buy used electronics from my ex-employer, test them, and resell them on places like marketplace. I'm currently studying and this job is perfect since I can make it fit with my schedule. Last year I made about 4000$, 2000 of which I deposited in my bank account so far.  I also have 3000$ cash from the revenues of this month and what I didn't deposit yet. I'd prefer putting it all at the bank right away but wouldn't want to raise any red flags or anything. I don't plan making much revenue this year except from that one job, which might seem suspicious if I'm not employed anywhere else.

Since I'm not exactly registered or considered a business, where would I declare such revenue on my tax return. Will it be too risky if I deposit all of my money right away, should I keep it liquid? And if I deposit it would I be able to pass it as revenue from last year or would I have to wait for the 2021 tax return?

Cash-Out Refinance vs Refi+HELOC?,"Wife and I have owned our own home for 5 years and have just had a child and are looking to move into something bigger.  We would like to keep our current home and rent it out, while moving into the new home we purchase.  

&#x200B;

I am wondering what the preference is from the PFC community.  Cash-out refinance? or a Refinance + HELOC (Like a BMO Readiline, or TD FlexLine).  

&#x200B;

They both seem to do what we need them to do, the Readiline or FlexLine is tempting because we will likely want to do renovations on the home we purchase, but I'm not sure if the straight cash-out refi is a better option?  And then get a HELOC afterwards when we decide on the renos/improvements (after pandemic).

A Toronto Housing Case Study,"I'm not one to usually care all that much about housing since I have zero intentions of ever owning property here, but I decided to do some math this morning...

According to [this statistic](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/dv-vd/inc-rev/index-eng.cfm) from StatsCan, a $125,000 individual income puts you in the top 5%, even in Toronto. (Set Category to CMAs - Ontario). Considering the numbers are slightly outdated, let's adjust it to top 6%. At this income level, you're absolutely killing it relative to the rest of the city and province.

If individuals paired up randomly, then the chance that two people both earned $125k or more is (0.06 * 0.06 = 0.0036) or 0.36%. Let's assume that like attracts like and say that 2% of households earn $250k or more.

Taking the 4x - 5x rule, they are able to borrow $1.25M max plus a $250k DP = $1.5M home. In Toronto proper, that gets you a small-ish home that I would consider middle-class. The doorways are tight, the rooms are small. Like [this.](https://www.realtor.ca/real-estate/22692938/99-elinor-ave-toronto-wexford-maryvale)   In the suburbs, that gets you something a little bigger, but imo still textbook upper-middle-class. A house that is clearly built for size, not design. No discernible features, just a square box with a decent sized backyard, neighbours all around you with no privacy whatsoever. You can practically touch your neighbour's home by reaching your arm out of one the side windows. Kinda like [this.](https://www.realtor.ca/real-estate/22751029/3773-quiet-creek-dr-mississauga-churchill-meadows)

So let me get this straight:   
Step 1. Get a job that pays you $125k, within the top 6% of the city. Almost 1 in 20.   
Step 2. Be willing to pair up simply so you can own a decent home.     
Step 3. Find said partner and make sure that they ALSO make $125k or more.   
Step 4. Together save a DP of $250k and do it quickly enough that the housing prices haven't increased more while saving.  
Step 5. Be approved for the max. $1.25M, which means that you BOTH cannot have any major blemishes on your credit report. Little to no outstanding debt, stable jobs, good credit score.   
Step 6. Buy middle-class house.

You mean to tell me that you're absolutely winning at life and that's all you get? This is a scam. When I think of people who are in the top 1-2%, I imagine that they live in houses that are more like within the $2.5M - $3M range in Toronto. Like [this.](https://www.realtor.ca/real-estate/22762010/135-ranee-ave-toronto-englemount-lawrence) Not quite mega-mansions, but clearly have design and flair, spacious rooms and privacy. Even if your parents are able to give you a hefty care package (say $100k - $200k extra on the DP) that doesn't really help you out all that much either. It's insane. Top 2% to live in what would otherwise be a middle-class house in DT. I'm losing my mind. What am I missing or are my expectations of what wealth ought to look like completely off-base?",527,1612037288.0,2021,2021-01-30,Housing,Afrofreak1,545,l8ufla
Financial Advice in need for myself who got kicked out...,"Good day everybody,

22F,  about to get kicked out because my views aren't the same as my parent's religion. Very extremist might I say, and there is nothing I can do to convince them to change their decision. It's either I'd have to go back to them but I don't think my mental health can no longer endure with being forced. Anyways, I went back to University to do my prerequisites for a program in a college I plan to apply to. My program starts in August 2021, assuming I do get in. I have no relatives or blood-relative families here in my city. My cousin is 2 provinces away and she has her own family, so even my attempt to approach seems... not the best for this time. I have about 10K in savings, work part-time until the end of June at the moment where I earn $300-$400 bi-weekly (I work at a school so my work only goes until there). My due date where I get a kick out is when I finish my prerequisites, which is until the end of April, but I'd like to extend it as much as I can until June. Assuming I get into college, I would need to devote myself full-time to the course because it is compressed and the first year is mostly theory. It requires me to go M-F 9 AM-4 PM at the school. If I do work, it'll mostly just be the weekend. What is your best recommendation as to how I should work with my savings and place of stay?

My emergency backup, in the case I get kick out, I plan to lounge or stay with my friends for a couple of months to rent out a room. I don't wish to burden them so my ideal time of stay is 6 months - 1 year maximum. I don't want to blow my 10K away because I used my savings to pay for my Uni too. If I do get into my program, I plan to do student grants and loans. My program is 2 years. Do you think it's possible for me to rent out a bachelor's/studio or should I just keep renting out a room?",10,1612037261.0,2021,2021-01-30,,yharzi_71,2,l8uf6s

- Finance has always gone over my head. I want as little to do with playing with my money as possible, but I obviously want it to work for me. 
- I have no debt. Financially independent.

- Was with EQbank for the interest rate for saving my income. Was ok with the 1.2%? interest, but not anymore.
- I've been reading about TFSA and RRSP, but I haven't pulled the trigger due to analysis paralysis. 
- Currently have access to TD (for automated bill payment), RBC (used for VISA), EQ bank, and Quest trade (opened trading account years ago, but got too scared). What are you guys using to just ""set it and forget it?"".

car insurance settlement - lowballing,"Hi there,

After they evaluated the car listings I sent them, they just increased the settlement for a 1000 dollars, which is still not enough?

What should I do next?
Just tell them straight that I still feel it's not fair? Send them more listings of the same car? Ask them to include my old car since its a total loss so I can sell the parts myself to make up for the loss they are causing me?

Diversification on Pasive & Actively managed portfolios,"Hey all,

I am 28 years old and as of recently built up my emergency fund to cover 4 months of expenses. I am now looking to expand into better managing my RRSP and TFSA while contributing to emergency fund to bring up to 6 months.  I currently have about $10k in RRSP and $0 in TFSA as I used it to pay for a masters degree a few years back.  Both accounts are with Wealthsimple, but I am moving them to Questrade.  I have a DCPP and LIRA tied up with Sunlife that are managed in various ETFs with roughly a 85-15 Equity to Bond split.  Equity split between SPY, TSX, and Global ex US split.  Bond is generic fund focused on low MER. I have zero debt.

&#x200B;

I am wondering how you approach diversification with Passive vs Active management or a mix of both.

&#x200B;

I am looking to expand my RRSP and TFSA portfolio into a mix of passive and active.  My initial thoughts are maintaining an 80-20 passive active split, rebalanced quarterly depending on volatility within either portfolio subset.

&#x200B;

Passive Funds:

1. Are you looking into global diversification? Or just holding SPY or TSX Comp 60 funds? 
2. How are you arriving at your E/B split?  Are you just 100% equities and using Dividend yields as income in a low Fixed Income yield environment?

&#x200B;

Active Management:

1. What strategies do you employ?  Do you you buy specific stocks or are you overweighting/underweighting specific industries (ex. 2020 Overweight Tech/Consumer Basic, underweight Utilities)?
2. How do you approach diversification with individual stock picking? Are are these primarily YOLO plays with diversification being achieved comfortable with passively managed index ETFs?

Advise Company owes me money,"Hello All,

This is a throw away account.

I am looking for some advice as my previous employer owns me about 16K in wages.

About a year ago I used to work for a startup technology company in the GTA. I left after the company failed to acquire more funding and couldn't pay me. I filed an employee standards claim and the labour officer awarded me my full wages. The labour board couldn’t acquire the money so after about 6 months it was sent to the ministry of finances for collections.

Consumer proposal (Alberta).

"If you are thinking about having kids, now might be the best time to try","The [experts](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/12/17/the-coming-covid-19-baby-bust-update/) are [suggesting](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/11/covid-19-pandemic-births-baby-bust/617149/) that Covid-19 will cause a baby bust in 2021. We'll start seeing the hard data on this at the end of this month. And it makes sense. People are nervous about the future, their jobs, getting sick while pregnant and so on.

But...

If there are fewer kids born in the 2021 cohort it will mean that for the kids who are born this year, there will less competition for everything as they grow up. It will be easier to find daycare spots, easier to get into desirable schools outside your boundaries, easier to get into university, easier to find a job. And for mom, less hassle getting good pre-natal care (once the pandemic ends of course).

One of the worst years to be born in Canada in recent decades was [1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Academic_Credit). Why? The [double cohort](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ontario-s-double-cohort-strains-resources-1.360698) in Ontario meant stiffer competition all around for everything for those kids relative to those before or since.

How can I continue to maintain a balanced portfolio if I leave canada?,"I got kind of a unique question... I was born in canada and lived here all my life, but I am considering leaving canada permanently and moving to my parents' country of origin, a small poor non-western country. Currently all my money is in VGRO. I spoke to a few relatives in that country, and none of them even knew what an ETF is. It seems nobody there invests in the stock market, most people in that country are too poor to invest, and the few who have any money just invest in local real estate and become landlords, or open businesses. The country does have its own stock exchange but from some quick googling I did, I couldn't find any ETFs on it, and I don't feel safe putting my life savings in their local stocks. So my question is, how can I continue to maintain a balanced, globally diversified portfolio, ideally a single low-cost ETF or a small number of ETFs, if I live in a country that doesn't offer such a thing through its own stock exchange?

Contributing to RRSP without company contribution,"I am looking for help understanding how people contribute to their RRSP. 

At my previous company they were set up to deduct a percent from my paycheck and contribute it before tax directly to my RRSP, which they would match. My new company does this also, but instead of it going to a RRSP, it goes to their RPP. This is still great and I make max contributions.  However, as I am currently making a good salary I would like to also contribute to a RRSP to reduce the tax on my paychecks, and then allow me to utilize those funds for the Home Buyers Plan. My company told me I cannot contribute to a RRSP through them as they are not set up for that. 

On this sub I constantly see everyone saying to max out TSFA and RRSP, my question is though, is everyone that is maxing their RRSP doing so through their company deducting contributions from their paychecks?

It is my understanding that if I were to contribute to a RRSP not through my company I would have to put in my already taxed income, and then be taxed on it again at a later date when I take it out, which defeats the purpose. 

Would love any insight/ clarity anyone can provide me on this.

Personal health insurance during gap between employer benefits?,"I'm taking a new job and there is a waiting period (six months) before I will be covered under my new employer's benefits.  I'm looking for health insurance to cover the gap between my current (group) benefits and the new coverage.  I've looked at Blue Cross, Manulife, Sun Life and Greenshield, and none of them are really what I'm looking for.

Ideally, I would like

* No waiting period before benefits kick in.  I need coverage to start soon.
* No dental or vision.  These costs are fairly predictable even if I need work done, and I don't see the point in paying an insurance company to reimburse me.  I really just want insurance for unexpected events, not routine costs over the next few months.
* Definitely drug coverage and other medical expenses (e.g., physiotherapy) that I hope I don't need, but that can really blow up if I get run over tomorrow
* No medical questionnaire.  These questionnaires are a pain in the ass, just for a few months coverage, and usually come with a waiting period anyway.

Alternative investments than the stock market.,"Hey guys,   


I'm looking to invest 400,000 to 500,000 towards my retirement and goals of a steady stream of passive income or a small business. I feel like I have an opportunity as I have cash in hand, and am wondering if there are any good methods of investing where cash is more beneficial. I.E. refilling ATMs and collecting the fees. I know that some people have made tons of money flipping houses but I don't see that as a smart path for me as I am not able to do much renovation work myself and worry about the volatility of our housing market. I am open to being a franchisee but it seems that many are more trouble than it's worth for the amount they require. Especially in the time of COVID where your business could be forced into bankruptcy by lockdowns, or the parent company making stupid decisions.

I am fairly young and have no real obligations so I am open to exposing myself to some risk, . By the same token, I'm not looking to go grey by the time I turn 30. I currently have had it with a broker and made 7-10% returns consistently the past few years. However, (20/20 hindsight) my broker pulled my positions just before the drop in march, so I am sitting 100% in cash.

"Switching cars after only a year, depreciation hurts, but I wanna see what the best options are","Hey guys, my wife and I bought a certified pre-owned Audi A4 last year. While we liked many aspects of the car, including the tech, driving experience, and the luxurious feel, we had just moved to Vancouver (from Toronto) and had no idea what the driving conditions here were. 

The roads in Vancouver have so many damn potholes. And the visibility during winter with all the rain and lack of light is very rough, especially with all the SUV's and trucks surrounding us. Since our car has a dynamic suspensions and larger wheels, we FEEL every single bump on the road. On top of that the drivers here are quite... Something. Driving to the mountains on the sporty sedan has also not been so fun.

Being on the road has been extremely stressful and we've originally planned to keep this car for at least 5 years, but we are seriously considering cutting our losses and switching to a SUV.

The car has depreciated about 5k over the year, yup sucks a lot. If I sell the car privately, I would get around 30-32k. Trade-in value was appraised at 27.5-28k at certain dealerships, we've been looking at RAV4, CX-5, etc. 

Here's the catch, we would really hate to downgrade to a non-luxury brand because we do really enjoy all the bells and whistles that come with the luxury cars. But we don't wanna drop another 20k to get a 1-2 year luxury SUV. So we are wondering if we should lease a luxury SUV at this point. 

I don't know what the best way to, well, lose money would be since we know that we will be losing money. Just want some advice on what the best way might be to handle this totally first world problem. Thanks in advance!",9,1611990166.0,2021,2021-01-30,Auto,apmgaming,0,l8g82q

He financially supported me as I've struggled with mental health issues since I was a child and am currently unable to go to school or work. We had a very close relationship which is why he left me practically everything he owned in his will. 

In Canada, he co-owned our family home which is valued at around 1.5M with my mother and he left me his half of the property. He also had around 50k in his bank which he also left to me. In China, he owned a property valued around 1.5-2M that he rented out to a company for an annual rental payment of around 45k. As my dad passed away in China, I flew there from Canada with my family to plan his funeral and handle any family matters. While I was in China we were able to process the property transfer so the property he owned in China is now mine and I will be receiving the annual rental payment. I also inherited around 75k from the money he had in China. 

My dad left me almost everything he owned so I really want to be responsible with his money and make sure I don't waste what he worked his whole life working for. What can I do with my inheritance to financially support myself in the best way possible? I have also not reported or notified the Canadian government of anything yet as I haven't been mentally well enough to do so. The inheritance money I received in China is still in a bank account there, I have not brought back or transferred any of the funds to Canada. I have not begun any legal processes in Canada yet like transferring his half of the house to me or accessing his bank account here. I'm really not sure what my next steps should be, where/who I should solicit help from, and what info I might not be aware of currently that I should know. 

I would greatly appreciate any help at all, any advice or insight would be helpful. Thank you to anyone who's still reading this.

Edit: Sorry, I realize I left out a couple important details that might make my story confusing. My mom and dad were divorced which is why she wasn’t left anything in his will. I have a younger sister but because my parents got divorced in China, the court split custody between my parents so that my dad had custody of me and my mom had custody of my sister. This means most of my dad’s inheritance was left to me while most of my mom’s inheritance will be left to my sister, however she did also receive around $75k. 

I also just wanted to thank everyone so much for your help, I didn’t expect so many responses and I’m truly so grateful. I will be reading each response carefully to try and decide what my next steps will be.",63,1611988041.0,2021,2021-01-30,,fallsviews,149,l8fpdp

"Individual with 80k income and a mortgage, do you have to penny pinch in life?","For example, I make 80k/yr and I have a  1br condo on mortgage like this one https://i.imgur.com/xMvVjNq.jpg

My total monthly payment would be just shy of $2500.

Add another $150 for hydro and internet. I'm at $2750. 
At 80k after deductions, I would make about $4500 (including $300 rpp deductions with 100% match from employer so its a no brainer). So I have about $1300 for expenses each month. And if I put $500 of that in the TFSA each month i would basically have nothing left after spending for groceries ttc and other stuff.



On the other hand if I rent a similar apartment it would be around $1500-1700 and I could live more comfortably and/or invest wisely.

Looking to get into ETF trading with WealthSimple Trade but concerned about lack of fraud protection,"Hi all,

I'm looking at getting into the world of ETF's  andI'm evaluating whether to use Wealthsimple trade or Questrade. Most of the reviews and articles are pointing me towards the former, especially because I'm quite frugal and want to minimize fees. None of the stuff I read mentioned the fact that they have no protection against unauthorized transactions/fraud though, and I'm wondering if I'm missing something here? One reddit thread mentioned this and people were like ""eh whatever it has two-factor authentication"" but Robinhood had a security breach last October where 2000 lost money to hackers, many of whom had 2 factor authentication. Seems to me like it's a pretty poor idea to put a big chunk of my equity into a platform that is unwilling to reimburse me if they're compromised and I lose everything through no fault of my own.

I realize as part of my personal taxes I can defer capital gains, but would I believe I would still have to pay 20% each year.

Emergency Savings Strategy,"My main question is how to approach putting together an emergency savings. Based on my estimation, my emergency savings amount should be about $10,000. Right now, if I do nothing else but put all extra toward that goal, it would take me another 3-4 months or so to achieve it. However, I would have no other spending money for the time being.

My two possible strategies would be:
1. $2000 per month from here on for 3-4 months with absolutely no extra spending  
2. $830 per month for the rest of the year with ~$1100 per month extra (to use for buying things I want, or to invest more freely in equities, etc.)

Let me break down my situation and ask how you guys might approach this:

Student loans: $550/month (0% and 2.5% interest)  
Rent: $550/month  
Bills: ~$300/month  
Car (car payment@4.0%): $620/month  
Car (Insurance): $230/month  
Daily Expenses (food, entertainment, gas, eating out, clothes, etc.): $1000/month  
Total:  
$3250/month

Current monthly income (after tax and $700/month RRSP contribution):  
$5300

This leaves me with about $2000/month in disposable income.

Last year, annual was $80,000. This year $100,000. Last year I paid off $7000 over 3 months in credit card debt and have stayed at 0 since then. I spent a not-insignificant amount getting things fixed, and buying things the car needed (tires, etc.) all paid in cash over the course of this year.

Now, I'm ready to create that emergency savings.

I tend to do things in a ""100% risk intolerant"" way, generally. What I'd like to know is, can I be more lenient on myself and actually have disposable income, or should I be putting it all toward the emergency savings goal?

A few notes to add:
1. Credit available to me includes ~$20,000 in credit card space, and $20,000 in credit line @ 7% space. (Double note: these are all at $0 balance, paid every 2 weeks/every month or as expenses come in.)

2. Around this time next year, I will be given vested stock currently valued at $110,000 CAD (pre-tax), and will from then on, every 3 months, be given additional vested stock valued at $27,000 CAD (pre-tax). Assuming the stock doesn't change, this will make my annual income about $210,000.

So given all of that, would it be too risky of me to take on the $830 per month plan? Or should I be saving $2000 per month?",9,1611970052.0,2021,2021-01-29,Budget,ReasonableSail1363,2,l8abcn
Credit Cards & Activations,"Hello,

I have a question in regards to Credit Cards, Activating Credit Cards and Credit Score/History. I currently have three Credit Cards: 

* BMO World Elite MasterCard - Limit: $8500 - Daily use
* CIBC Visa Select - Limit: $1000 - Not in use - $0 balance
* AMEX SimplyCash - Limit: $3300 - Not in use - $0 balance

The BMO Card I use nearly exclusively for everything, it gets paid to $0 every month. The CIBC Visa is my oldest credit card (15 years), and offers nearly no benefits/rewards, so I don't use it at all. My AMEX I opened for when I used to have a small business (which is no longer) and I used to charge only business expenses to it. Since I no longer have the business, it just sits at a $0 balance.

I was tempted to cancel the CIBC and AMEX credit cards, but I've read that that may not be good for your credit history as it would increase my overall credit utilization. I don't really see the need to use them as I bank with BMO and its just easier to pay the BMO card and see it instantly reflect since the banks are the same.

Bottom line is... If I just leave the CIBC and AMEX cards in a drawer, they eventually expire and I get sent new cards, but I don't activate the new cards, is there any negative to not activating them?

To make things worse, I am not particularly interested in owning right away but fear of being priced out is pushing me to purchase. I am 39 so not a great deal of time on my side. There isn't a good scope for my salary to increase in London. I also fear if I lose my job then what else would I find here. Remote job would be good. My job has scope in Toronto but even getting an apartment condo would be more expensive with very high condo fees and if I rent there for a few years I would probably get priced out of everywhere.

The plan is if things get bad I look at renting this or selling this. I understand prices don't always go up fast but I have lost faith in that argument in Ontario. Worst case I lose money (realtor + mortgage penalty + moving, legal, transfer, rent difference ...) but I feel the risk of not buying one might be greater. It's a terrible situation.

I will have quite some money remaining after the purchase. I have been terrible at investing my money over the years though.

The whole concept of renting and investing the difference doesn't seem to be promising because then where do I live in retirement and will I be able to afford it if the housing cost continues at the current rate.

Very confused. Would like to get inputs from others.",28,1611968056.0,2021,2021-01-29,,tmp_handle,7,l89mnk

"Tax professionals, I have a question.","I work for a large company, based in Canada and the have offices elsewhere.

I want to apply via HR for permission to move to Barbados for two months. I know working in another country can create tax liabilities, but also know that as part of the program the Bajan government will not be expecting participants of their 12 month stamp program to pay income tax.

My question is, does their program, which clearly states not expected to pay income tax absolve my company of any tax liabilities should they allow me to do this? I want to eliminate any road they would have to say no before applying and basically anything that causes anyone five minutes of work will be a roadblock.

Pros/Cons to buying a new EV (BC),"Potential rebates:
6K BC Scrap-It Program on current eligible vehicle
5K Federal Rebate
3K BC Rebate

Pros: 14K off the ticket price sounds quite appealing for a new car. Plus a good portion, if not the majority of its use is for self-employment, which then that portion can currently have a large write-off come tax time because it's an EV.
It will have the full warranty.
The rebate is available this year, and may be retracted in the future

Cons: Even 14K off it's still going to be a 30K plus tax expense, whereas a used PHEV/EV can still qualify for around 3K in rebates and be a lot less expensive.
The options through Scrap-It are limited (more so than the BC and Fed rebate program).
They are all fairly small and, unless this vehicle will solely be used for the business, it won't accommodate other uses, like driving a family of 4 plus dog around anywhere. Therefor a second vehicle would be required.
Buying used comes with shorter or no warranty, and shorter life on the battery if PHEV/EV (expensive to replace)

"Kinda want to move out of parents house for first time and take advantage of the historical low rental rates in downtown Toronto. Parents say stay and wait till september and save more for a downpayment. ""should i stay or should i go now""[ontario]","- 24yo making 67k a year 4k a month 

- wfh since start of covid. Company has said no return to office at least july + 6 months for people who temporarily moved out to come back. ""to start feeling safe to return to work"" was the quote

- My parents house is over in Durham region which, when we go back to the office is 1.5 hour communte on a train, car and walking. So in the future I will 100% need to move out closer to work

- would be first time moving out of parents basement

- rent prices are so low right now that ive found a 1+1den 700sqft which includes all utilites and parking spot for 1700 which could have been as high as 2500 before covid.

- maxed out rrsp/tfsa(45k) plus 6 months of savings in HISA with 0 debt

- even if I wait another 6 months saving 3500 a month, even if I have a 100k downpayment, Banks wont lend you more than 4-5x your income (i checked apperently i can get 275k only) Theres no way id be able to even come close to afford a condo downtown which lets be honest is the only way for a single income to own property

- parents are doing the classic ""why pay someone elses mortgage"" also litterally think that rent shouldnt be more than $500. The last time they rented was 30 years ago in 1990 and are completely out of touch with the current market. 

So I think theyre just out of touch saying that renting is stupid. Though they have a point saying living at home rent free for another 6 months can save a lot. I think that locking in that rent-controlled price is huge.

There is a huge risk that the rent prices will spike in the summer, which could bring them back to what they were in 2019. This is what im really worried about and im not sure what I should do

Anyone have any insight?

How to get out of Primerica and start self-managing?,"Hey all,

So I am brand new to this sub-reddit but have been following along here and there... what with all the news about stocks recently, I've decided to finally bite the bullet and start looking at self-managing.

I got roped into Primerica through a friend and currently have a life insurance policy and a TFSA with AGF (\~$7k).

What should I do? I thought I may as well keep it simple and move my TFSA to either Wealthsimple or Questrade. From what I know, Wealthsimple is easier to get set up on ($0 to open an account, no fees, but takes a while to process transactions) but Questrade is a better platform (more options, low fees, $1000 minimum to open an account).

My other question would be this:

If I am interested in trading, what kind of account should I open? of course I would keep my TFSA as such, but I would not want to be trading in that account as it will be considered business activity by the CRA, and your boy is not trying to get audited. I know with wealthsimple, I can open a general sort of account where everything is taxed, and my thought would be to trade in that type of account, and contribute to my TFSA from that (if I so please)/use it to continue trading here and there. Does QT have something similar? Is this what their ""margin"" account is?

I am new to this but really want to start deeply understanding and taking control of my personal finances. I started when I was 20 and am now 25, prior to Primerica I had investments with WFG but in any case my contributions were low ($1200/year) which means now I would theoretically have more room to contribute, however I guess it wouldn't carry over if I'm opening a new account and putting that money in. At this point I'm willing to accept DSC fees to just get out, who cares? I just want to know what the best way to proceed is...

Thanks in advance to all who contribute, I'm glad to finally be taking part in this sub!",14,1611957751.0,2021,2021-01-29,Investing,jadmusic,5,l85m3c

How to obtain old bank statements or transaction history,"I read about the TD VISA Debit hack and I'm getting paranoid that my bank accounts may have been hacked in the past and I do not know about it still.

These f\*\*king morons have never mailed me any bank statement at all since the time I opened my account with them. How is that even legal? I checked my online banking but I cant find any pdf statements there and can only see the transaction history for the past year or so.

How concerned should I be about my accounts being hacked in the past? Is it a common occurrence, or highly unlikely but is glamorized in the media a lot. My accounts dont seem to have been drained. Is it true that if I were hacked, I would have already lost all my money by now?

These accounts that I'm talking about, I literally opened them just to save money and make deposits into. I don't use it for day to day banking purposes, and hence never bothered to check online banking. This also means that I have never used my debit card at all, and it is sitting in a locked cabinet. If this is the case, can I still be hacked?

How do I ask the bank for every transaction that has ever occurred on all of my accounts since I first opened the account? Is there a maximum retention period after which they must destroy records? This seems like a futile attempt, since you need to notify them right away, but still I would like to know?

I now realize that fraudsters LOVE accounts like mine, where the owner doesn't use it often and never bothers to check.

PS. Is it even legal that they never sent my any statements at all for all of these years? Online banking is the biggest scam, since no one ever bothers to check.

I’m 30 and getting serious about life. Should I go back to university?,"I just turned 30 this year, and I’m realizing that I need to make a serious shift in my career.

I’m from Quebec. At 18, I started university for journalism to eventually get to law school, but I felt like it wasn’t the right choice for me. I wanted to write and illustrate a book so I decided to go went to a trade school for commercial art. It was great, but I got intimidated by the industry and took a step back to work in a family business doing tech support for a few years.

I left the business last year, and despite getting paid close to minimum wage, I’m really starting to get my shit together! I’m so proud of myself. I went from constantly being in the red to now having 7000$ (also a 3000$ debt from a semester of programming school). 

Now I have a job with benefits doing a sort of tech support, and also am a freelance writer at night. I’m not making a lot freelancing at the moment, but embarrassingly enough, I had thought the jobs would “find me”. (I know, criiiinge.) Having said that, the articles I’ve published have gotten good replies and I’m positive about it.

RRSP advice for newb,"30 yrs old, new to anything financial.  All I know is taxes blow when I'm paying 15000 a year to em.

I never had an rrsp, never opened one in my life.  Lately I am trying to get everything in order such as debt (mortgage I'm at 2.45% have less than 100'000 owing, car is 3% and have 3 months left) but also trying to make the most out of my savings.

I have discovered I can claim unused contributions on this years tax return from previous years.  Does that actually apply to me since I never had an opened rrsp account?

All this curiosity came as my bank offered me 5'000 at 2%. I have access to roughly 15'000 cash, and a 20'000 line of credit at 4%.

I made 52'000 last year and paid apx 15'000 into taxes.  What I am thinking is _IF_ I can roll over my unused contributions for the RRSP, in theory I can dump enough cash into my  new RRSP that it brings me below the taxable income amount this year?

Is this a prohibitively stupid time to be selling / buying a home?,"Hey folks,

Just looking for some sage internet wisdom. Does the idea of selling a condo and buying a larger space in the midst of this pandemic strike anyone as a particularity foolish thing to do? If so, why?

**Updated Context:**

* Our existing condo property has effectively ""**doubled**"" in value since we bought it.
* We have about **$400k** in savings in various forms, about **$100k** in equity.
* Prospect of working remotely is **strong** for both partners.
* We **can** afford an increase in housing cost. 
* Looking for **more space** to help accommodate growing family.
* Current mortgage is **1/3** paid off.

With working remotely, we're considering selling now and getting something bigger further out of town. We've had conflicting advice from our advisors and family / friend circles about this topic.

Advice - Student loan,"Hi everyone,

I am currently in my 2nd year law school.

I just have a few questions:
Here is some background 

1. I will be graduating with around ~120k of government student loans. (No other debt) 
2. I have about ~18k combined in WS Invest + Trade + Emergency Fund 
3. I have already signed an articling contract once I graduate.
The question is:
1. Should I aggressively pay off the government student loan, fully utilizing my combined 18k, or continue to invest?

Amateur questions - HISA and passive investments,"  

Hi everyone,

Recently graduated, have built up emergency savings (10 months worth). No CC debt. Only have OSAP and a student line of credit to repay as my debt. I have a steady job and income. Also in the process of setting up a side gig of architectural visualizations to make extra cash to pay down OSAP in 4-5 years timeline. I am starting to engage in learn about personal finance. I have set up a budget. I am planning to follow the Canadian Couch potato method.

1. I have only had Scotiabank student savings account. I have been looking at EQ bank for a HISA. I was a bit confused. On the EQ website, there is Savings plus account with 1.5% interest and a TFSA of 2.3% interest. What is the difference? Which one is more ideal to have your emergency savings in?
2. One of my relative suggested opening wealthsimple passive investment TFSA, (maybe not a lot at the moment as I am looking at paying down the debt first). My understanding is that, wealthsimple creates a portfolio based on your risk level and goals. You don’t really get pick what ETFs you are investing into. Am I understanding this right? When I read more in detail I was a bit confused; I reckon it is different from Wealthsimple trade. So when people on here say passively invest in ETFs, do they pick what ETFs to invest in? or do they mean just make regular contributions into accounts such as the ones in Wealthsimple Invest. 

Thank you to everyone here, I have been a long time lurker here, and it has really helped me understand finances better and creating emergency savings.",7,1611949412.0,2021,2021-01-29,Investing,off_their_perch,0,l8219a

Housing Market Completely Out Of Control In SW Ontario - rant,"Edit - as many seem to be missing the point of this rant.
I am a contractor now with less than 2 years of accrual time, which explains the mortgage amount.
The rant is not about ""why are house prices so high because I can't get in"". The rant is about how in the hell will future generations not be screwed by this! 
It is a supply and demand issue, GO FIGURE... The problem is the supply is being artificially lowered to keep prices high, hence why I'm arguing for less red tape and less investors using housing as an investment vehicle.




Outside of Windsor, you cannot enter the market as a first time home buyer in Ontario for under 550K, unless you get a crap hole that requires 100K + in Reno's just to make it livable.

What are the future implications of this on our society? While I understand Toronto and Vancouver are becoming/already are elite world market cities, why is Canada's housing 40% higher than the US?

I'm an engineer, my wife is a teacher. We bring in roughly 160K/yr gross, and are amongst the top earning careers you can have as 'normal' people in the province (yes obviously some people make more, but most make much less).

We have 150K+ in savings, little debt (under $300/month), and the banks would only lend up to 400K with the tighter restrictions in place.

In the past year since the start of the pandemic home prices have risen nearly 50% in our area. In almost all areas home prices have surged past the point of affordability for first time home buyers:

Toronto/Mississauga/Scarborough/Oshawa/Peterborough/Lindsay/Barrie/Hamilton/Niagara Falls/Kitchener/Cambridge/Waterloo/Kingston/Belleville/Ottawa/London/Windsor/Sarnia/Stratford/Listowel/Kincardine/Port Elgin/Etc etc etc

This is crazy and unless regulations are put into place banning rental income properties and foreign investment, then our children will never own property. 

In fact, with rents now being as high as they are in every part of the province, our children won't even be able to rent out a place and will have to live with their parents forever.

3 things our government should do to fix the Supply and demand ratio:

1) Remove the red tape on purchasing land/subdividing plots/zoning laws in general

2) Impose a tax on all properties anyone owns greater than 2 (i.e. you get a principle residence and a supplemental residence and that's it). The tax should be prohibitive (10% home value per year) to discourage homes being used as investment vehicles

3) Use this tax money to directly subsidize builders/developers/Reno companies to encourage a great deal of new builds/fixing up of older homes


-----Extension of Rant------

What really grinds my gears is that Canada (all western nations really) are completely OK with having minimum wages, child labor laws, unions, safety protocols, environmental regulations, etc. And they should. These are good things.

But then we allow companies to take their production out of our countries, and produce in countries with NONE of those protections for people or the environment (i.e. China/India/Indonesia/Mexico until recently, Brazil/etc etc etc).

Then when those nations get a middle class that gets extremely wealthy, but don't want to live in their countries anymore, they leave their home countries and use that money to come to Canada (and everywhere else) and drive up housing prices so that native Canadians cannot afford to live any longer? However, given that Canada has risen higher than virtually any other country since the start of 2020, there is clearly other factors at play (is this because we are more lax and do almost no background checks outside of income for the past 3 months when cash is used on purchases?).

It's a global scam, and I'm glad GameStop happened to highlight how corrupt the top levels of our government, and the 'wealthy elite's' are around the world, and how complicit in the absolute erosion of ordinary lives they are, until their own money is threatened.

Nothing will ever change though, so until then I'll keep saving and hoping for interest rates to rise substantially so that people who over extended themselves feel discomfort, those who thought they could profit from unfair rental prices are forced to sell at a loss, foreign economies shrink enought so that investors stop using Canadian housing a shelter for their surplus cash, and other investment vehicles outperform the housing market causing even further selloffs.

Realistically that won't happen, and so all I can do is hope that the amount I save per year eventually outpaces this crazy market.

On a road to financial independence - advice?,"I created my reddit account so I can make this post - haha, so thank you for taking the time to look at this firstly!

Secondly - I'm not going to lie. I grew up in quite a nice suburb, bubbled in from the real world, with my family and their middle-high income. I never had to worry about money, never felt pressured to get a job during my undergrad (even though I did, for experience purposes). But in short, I know jack shit about financial independence/saving. I'm terrible at saving, spend all my money like I'm richer than Beyonce  and I've always been afraid to confront this vice of mine, but I know it's time.

so 3 questions:

1. I only having a chequing account with Scotiabank right now. My only income is CRB, but I start a new job with the GoC next month, so I want to start saving the money I make. What should I look at when researching all the different savings account options?
2. I have a five month old. With guidance from my father (I'm a single parent), I've opened a RESP account for her. Is there anything else I should look into when saving for her future?
3. What other advice do you have on the road to financial independence and even....financial literacy. Again - spoiled child here, but I really really feel an urge to learn. If you could provide your advice or any resources, I would very much appreciate it.

Today I was quoted a nearly 40% higher mortgage break penalty than I was 18 days ago.,"Not looking for sympathy, more a buyer-beware. It's going to cost my wife and I an additional >10k or else stick around with this bank (Big 5).

We sold our condo and are buying a new home (close date: March 2) and asked our advisor to start the process for getting approval for porting our mortgage. We do have a few other options on the table from a financing perspective and asked him to provide a quote on the penalty for breaking our mortgage. On January 11, he provides our penalty as of that day (not as of our sale date) and we rely on that for our planning and ultimately decide to seek out other options and break the current mortgage.

Our advisor calls us today and now says or penalty is 38% higher than what was quoted. This is because they are now calculating the interest rate differential to a 4 year fixed mortgage, as opposed to 5 as he was previously. They also appear to be unable to come up with a written breakdown of either calculation. They are careful in all cases to say the penalty is ""subject to change"".

This is my gripe: My ""advisor"" needs to be accountable for providing us with information that supports our planning for what is a massive purchase. When the difference is 5 figures, they need to be able to quote our penalty as of our intended mortgage break date. That quote needs to be ""subject to changes in interest rates"", not ""subject to change"". The fact that I can't rely on, *again*, my ""**advisor**"" for this instead of a self-serve ratehub calculator is a bit absurd. 

Is there a regulator I can write to or is this something I should write to my MP about? I'm a reasonable person who understands that life isn't fair, but the housing market is hard enough before the banks get involved.

TL:DR Calendar changed and now I have to come up with 10k. The bank isn't your friend, nobody can look out for you like you.",6,1611945062.0,2021,2021-01-29,,paulnako,1,l8046g

23M feeling disheartened. Worried I'll be stuck at my job forever. Was rejected from an internal project coordinator position.,"I applied for an internal project coordinator position at the company I have been for just over 3 years and was rejected. This was pretty disheartening as I've worked in several roles for my company, had the background educational experience, and was capable of doing the tasks that would be asked of me. I work in the Health and Safety field and make about 56K a year. 

Even in the past I tried applying for other jobs, including field work, and was not given the opportunity. It's like there's thousands of applicants for these jobs which me and my office work like experience would never qualify. But I genuinely thought this is a job I would have gotten because I've always done what's asked of me, have been praised by my managers and have good rapport with everyone at my company. 

The only thing I have going for myself, and I genuinely am not trying to flex or be a douche, is I have saved up 62K with a 25K car paid off in cash. This is primarily because I've been fortunate enough to live with my parents and have always been extremely responsible in saving up money since I was young. But I'd give away some of that money to actually do rewarding work or have a meaningful job or career. 

I'm thinking about leaving my industry and possibly going into the trades. My brother works in the trades as a welder and does pretty good for himself. At least this way I would somewhat diversify my career and possibly could land a safety role.  

I was wondering if anyone has any guidance here or would give me recommendations on how to move on from this point. Also I live in Alberta. 

Also I fully recognize that I am fortunate to be employed and i sympathize with those who are out of work, I really really do. But I just really want to move forward and achieve more than be doing the same repetitive administrative work every year, especially in my younger years.

Scotiabank's security practices stress me out,"I'm not from Canada orginally, so I'm used to EU banking which seems much more secure in my opinion. Scotiabank stresses me out.

Firstly their website has no authentication beyond a short username and password. If you want to change your username and password it's also super easy with no 2FA needed at all. I understand the importance of accessibility but it feels so wrong.

If you apply for any credit increase, they email asking to send sensitive documents via email. Then they will get in touch through their secure email service which seems like a dodgey clunky old phishing site with barely any information available online as to what this to make you feel reassured it isn't a scam.

Then if you call any of the numbers (the credit solutions one isn't advertised on their site anywhere), they ask for your card number, 3 digits on the back etc for authentication. 

All of this seems to totally contradict what people are taught to do to avoid banking scams.

I wouldn't be transferring by withdrawing from the existing TFSA/RRSP account and depositing it into wealthsimple, I would be using the transfer process that wealthsimple provides on their site.

How to account for DB and employer DC contribution in savings rate % calculation?,"I've been taking a different approach to looking at how much we are saving.

I count my contribution into the DC and then our personal accounts obviously. I am less sure as to whether I should include the employer DC contribution amount, as that isn't actually reported as part of my salary. The employer DC contribution is not in the denominator in a savings/total income = savings% calculation, so I don't think I should include it in the numerator either then.

* I plan to activate this loan on Feb 26th and pay it back in one lump sum by March 3rd so the calculated interest would be ~$1?

"Advice needed, please read (Koodo collections)","(ON) I’ll spare details and give a very quick outline of what’s happened here. 2016 opened a Koodo phone line. June 2017 closed account, paid final bill and went to Rogers. Between June - October 2017 another Koodo bill was generated, even though account was closed. Couldn’t pay it online so added Koodo as payee online banking and paid it on a Friday morning. Here is what Koodo has told me 3 times via phone to verify;

Payment processed on: October 23rd (Monday)
Account sent to collections: October 22nd (Sunday)

They tell me even though I paid it, they didn’t process the payment till after it was sent to collections, therefor cannot remove the collections history from my report. I have called both equifax and Transunion multiple times, disputed it multiple times, and fought with Koodo for years with no success.

Immigrant TFSA contribution room,"Hello PFC,

I need your help to calculate my TFSA contribution room.

I moved to Canada in 2013 as a student, but started university with an offshore campus of Canadian Uni in 2012.  I was given a tax receipt for my 2012 tuition too, and thus filed my taxes for 2012 even though I had no status in Canada for that year. 

I made my first contribution to TFSA late 2020 and I assumed the contribution room quoted on my CRA profile was accurate. 

I just did the math, and turns out CRA calculates my contribution room from the year I turned 18 (2010) when I had no status in Canada. 

Am I wrong to assume CRA has the right numbers? 

TIA

Edit: thanks for the valuable information. On call with CRA. Their mistake, but I would still have to pay the penalty (+ interest) if I am over. Thankfully I'm slightly under.",3,1611940527.0,2021,2021-01-29,,pt008,0,l7y3or
Question regarding taxes - CRA (Ontario),"Hi all,

Hope  everyone is doing well. Just need some insight into the following  situation. My friend used to stay at an apartment and pay rent. Then she  had to move out due to increasing rent costs. Following this she was  told by her neighbors that she can stay at their apartment for sometime  as she didn't have any other option. The issue is she and her child is  not listed on the lease. So when she files taxes for the past year  (2020), would she need to provide a lease or claim rental expenses (she doesn't have any). She currently shares their address. Thanks in advance  for your input!",7,1611940466.0,2021,2021-01-29,,dpeter23,1,l7y2r4

My mother is 55 and on ODSP. What are her chances of being approved for a mortgage?,"Like the title says, my mom is 55, and is on ODSP. She makes a bit of money running a small business, but ODSP is her main source of income. She's rented all her life, but she desperately wants to own a home, and has been planning on buying a small house for a year now. She was very optimistic about it until today, when she told me she doesn't believe she would ever be approved for a mortgage. She had been under the impression that she could be approved if she got her sister to co-sign, but today she said she doesn't think it would work because her sister is also in her 50s. 

I don't know anything about this kind of thing. I'm 19, and my high school workplace math class was the closes thing I have to an education in personal finances. I assume we'll need to sit down with a professional to really figure all this out, but I think it's important for her to have a better idea of what she's working with and what her chances are in the meantime. She's described her feelings about continuing to rent for the rest of her life as ""soul crushing,"" and while I know that doesn't change her chances, I'd like to be able to give her an idea of what to expect before she goes into an appointment and potentially has her dream crushed.

VW Atlas Lease Buyout Fee... ridiculous,"TLDR:

1. Who gets lease buyout fees: **The Dealer or the Manufacturer**
2. Is there anything I can do to reduce or avoid them in the future?

I recently bought out my lease ( BC ) and they wanted to charge me a $500 lease buyout fee (in the contract) + $495 documentation fee ( + tax of course ).

However, they said they were are ""allowed"" (weasel words) to put the doc fee($495) towards the purchase of extended warranty.

I decided not to go ahead with the extended warranty ( $3700 ) and just pay the residual + fees.

When I went in to buy out the car, finance manager said they contacted VW and VW ""allowed"" them to also put the VW lease buyout fee ($500) toward the warranty... saying that the warranty is a 100% cash back warranty anyhow... at the end of the term, you get your money back if you haven't made a claim. and that the actual cost of the warranty then becomes $3700 - $995.

Anyhow, I decided to take it... thinking that I will not be making any claims.

Looking into the warranty (securedrive.ca), it's not a ""Cash-back"" warranty if you make no claims... you get $1000 in cash, or $2000 credit at the issuing dealership... or a credit to buy another warranty.

So, the warranty has a 30 day refund window. I exercised it. [securedrive.ca](https://securedrive.ca) wants me to go directly through the dealership. So, I do.

Finance manager is not happy with me... thinks I'm crazy, saying car computers cost $2000 to fix etc. Technology in cars is expensive. yada yada yada...

In my mind... I think of **purchased** warranties as **partial pre-payment** of repairs you may not have...

So... I'm pre-paying for $3700 of repairs... I only come out ahead if I have at LEAST $3700 of warranty claims in 4 years.

TLDR: After leaving the dealership, she emails me telling me that I now OWE the dealership $995 + tax and that she has to send some of that to VW for me cancelling the 3rd party warranty.

I know the fees is usurious, but I don't know if I **really** have any leverage.

**NOTE: I TOTALLY DON'T MIND PAYING SOME SORT OF SMALL DOC FEE. I understand that there is a small amount of time involved in processing a lease buyout and there are some overheads, I just HATE the dishonesty in overselling the warranty, and the excessive fees of $1000 just to do that.**

Not only that, but I notice that she signed me up for the most expensive ""ELITE"" warranty (of course) to maximize dealer profit.

Accountant doing T4s,"Hi.

How complex is generating T4s for a corporation?

I have a small trucking company that is incorporated. I pay myself a weekly salary. Do the payroll source deductions to the CRA each month and pay them online. There normally the same each month unless I withdraw more money that month for whatever reason (seams to be a few times a year) then I calculated the new withdraw with the CRA payroll calculator and pay more tax.

Now that it's tax time my accountant generates my T4s.  I send her all my bank statements and also a detailed spread sheet of all my withdrawals.

My expenses are all quite organized and come off a company visa.

When she does these T4s though the number don't match.  Let's say I withdraw 70k cash for my salary and pay 30k to CRA for payroll source deductions , cpp,ei, etc.

My accountant generates a t4 that shows 80k I asked last year about it and was told something along the line of "" will count some of that money as expenses.""

1. How bad is this

And 2.  If these T4s are just general numbers with no backing why can't I do it online myself?  I noticed that myCRA business website has an online forum option that you can just plug in the numbers and generate a T4.  
Doesn't seam to complex or am I missing something.

RRSP/T1-OVP Help,"Hi everyone,

I got my tax receipt for my Tangerine RSP Savings Account and I went over my limit (which was $7000 + $4000 leftover from last year) by about $6000.

I tried to fill out the T1-OVP form and when I broke down my deposits into the account month by month, the total amount for the year (March-December) was about $6000 more than what my receipt shows.

I did withdraw $28,000 from the RSP Savings Account in August to purchase service back from my pension plan, so I'm not sure if that affects the amount shown on the tax receipt? The final balance at the end of the year was only about $3000.

Can anyone make sense of this for me? I'm sorry I know every other post here lately has been about an over-contribution but I would really appreciate the help!

Is 6.99% interest typically the lowest a bank will go for an auto loan?,"I'm in a weird position so I'll explain briefly. 

My son is very sick, and a charity offered to help us. They are giving me a lease on a new vehicle for 2 years.

I figured I could take this opportunity to buy the vehicle myself afterwards but the interest rate at the dealship on used vehicles is 6.99%. I figured I'd just go to my bank to get a vehicle loan for the remainder of the balance, but the dealership told me that interest rate they're offering is the same the bank will offer. 

I've never bought a used vehicle before (does buying a lease count as used?) So I'm not sure if what they're saying is true since they also said I could just get another lease or a new vehicle after the lease is done with. And that kinda makes me distrustful of what the dealership is saying since it's in their best interest to upsell or keep selling more (not accusing them of lying, I'd just like to verify for myself).

WSB/GME: How One Bad Trade Can Ruin You,"I have dabbled in PFC over the years and I have always found this sub to be wonderful in terms of the level-headed advice and strong values that really make a long-term difference in people's financial well-being.

And so it's a bit jarring to see the WSB/GME jargon creep into the sub over the last few days (as it has everywhere) and I honestly feel somewhat of an obligation to address a few investment-related things:

**One Loss Can Wipe Out a Lifetime of Gains**

Investing has asymmetric outcomes. i.e. a 10% loss is not equivalent to a 10% gain. To recoup a 10% loss,  you actually have to make an 11% gain. And the difference grows exponentially, so if you lose 90% of your investment, you will now need to return 900% **just to get back to break even.**

the riskier your bets, the more asymmetric the outcomes.

but its worse than that: you can go on an awesome run where all your big bets are paying huge ... then erase it all with one bad trade.

*but its even worse that that*: it is a **statistical guarantee** that, over enough trades, you WILL make a bad trade.

**FOMO**

Humans are social animals. And good thing b/c we learn from each other. We have special brain cells called mirror neurons that fire when we do something, or when we see someone else doing something. Its what makes my 8 month old son bang away on the laptop keyboard like he's a WWII typist. Monkey see, monkey do.

And that approach to life is so successful in some parts that we naturally assume that it will work well in others. u/deepfuckingvalue made $40MM on GME, maybe I can too!?!?!

But this is where our meat sacs can lead us astray again and the trappings of this approach are well documented. See the [Madness of Crowds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraordinary_Popular_Delusions_and_the_Madness_of_Crowds#:~:text=Extraordinary%20Popular%20Delusions%20and%20the%20Madness%20of%20Crowds%20is%20an,Memoirs%20of%20Extraordinary%20Popular%20Delusions) and the [Great Crash of 1929](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Crash,_1929) and Tilray and Volkswagen and AOL TimeWarner and Amazon (yes, amazon was down 95% from its peak in 2001), and on and on. Everyone rushes in b/c everyone's making money b/c everyone is rushing in until there's no one left to rush in and the whole thing collapses.

Whatever anxiety or fear you have need only be understood and accepted, not reacted to, and then regardless of how you feel you must revert to your core principals: what am I buying and why? Do i think the investment is undervalued, do i like the dividend, what is the RISK / REWARD, WHAT ARE MY FINANCIAL GOALS? DOES THIS INVESTMENT FIT WITH MY GOALS? WHO IS ENCOURAGING ME TO BUY THIS INVESTMENT AND WHY??????

**There's BEING AGGRESSIVE, and then there's BEING DUMB**

Don't get me wrong, I love some of the WSB culture around YOLO/diamond hands/etc. You cannot be successful without having the fortitude to take some risks, either with your investments or in your personal life.

And if you take well-calculated, well-researched risks (typically on things no one else will), you will see the rewards. u/deepfuckingvalue is a great example. He has been holding GME calls for two years and took nothing but shit from the wsb crowd for a bad trade and sharing his fact-based, well-grounded and researched reasons for doing so along the way. Aggressive - and brilliant.

Buying a stock for 100x what it was a month ago, with no understanding of the business b/c you heard about it on the evening news is probably dumb.

I don't mean to get preachy. If you are on this sub, you are on the right path. Stick with the principals you have learned here and good fortune will snowball your way. And I'm not giving financial advice here, but I beg caution of anyone thinking about diving in now with a major proportion of their wealth (Whatever it may be). It could be gone in a week.",464,1611907979.0,2021,2021-01-29,,rskene,530,l7n7gr
Phone bill from 4 years ago,"I, a non-Canadian, was studying abroad in east side 5 years ago and I apparently forgot to pay my phone bill before I left.

Xbal/Xgro Portfolio during COVID,"I currently have around $3k in etfs (xbal) which is a 60/40 ratio. I'm in my twenties and potentially still have quite a few years left until I buy a home/retire/etc, what would you advise I do as my best option for the weird time we're in (low interest rates and all) but also possible correction?

Should I stay put with Xbal though it's higher in bonds, or should I start switching out to Xgro? I don't think I'd be comfortable with 100% equities in XEQT so I'm considering Xgro. Would it be safer to stay with higher bonds since we might have a market crash? Or are bonds going to be useless for the next while?

What is the best way to change from Xbal to Xgro - do I have to sell my Xbal shares completely and buy Xgro shares right away to start from a clean slate? Or do I keep my Xbal shares and just start buying Xgro shares from now on?

Over contributed to rrsp!,"Hi all! 

Hoping someone can help me out because I’m lost! 

 I was getting my tax stuff ready for this 2020 year and was looking at my NOA and saw that the amount in my contribution room for 2020 was negative 1200. 

I understand that if it’s less than 2k it’s all good and I won’t be penalized, BUT I have automatic deductions set up for my rrsp through work and from March 2020- till now I’ve contributed almost 7k

Looking back I have been technically over contributing since 2018 and my unused contributions previously reported and available to deduct for 2020 is around 6k where as my deduction limit is around 4K and hence  and finally this year my contribution room is negative 

I immediately stopped any contributions and am in the process of withdrawing the over contribution from the account. However when I called, they said it was subjected to withholding tax so I’ll be loosing around $1200

When I called cra the rep told me that I had to file the t1ovp despite withdrawing all the amount and then write a letter to the cra explaining what happened in hopes that they’ll be able to reimburse the withholding tax

I wanted to know if anyone has gone through this and if this seems right or if I’m missing something completely. 

I’m hoping since I caught it within the 90 day contribution if I just withdraw the entire thing will go away and I’ll be able to start a fresh since I haven’t filed my taxes for 2020 yet

Looking for career advice,"Hey all, I am 22 years old and just graduated out of university with a BA in Marketing and Consumer Culture. I feel like I chose the wrong degree and just stuck with it to finish. I dread the feeling of waking up and doing something I don't want to do everyday.

I'm hesitant because I feel like I will fall behind the people who have been doing it since they were young or in high school. I am also worried that I will be wasting even more of my time by doing a program that would be more beneficial at university.

At the end of the day, the intention is not to touch any of these RRSP accounts for a minimum of 5 years (might need to withdraw balance to pay for house), but the setup above just gives me piece of mind at night (The amount of funds placed in 8-9 risk is much smaller than the balanced and conservative accounts).

One corp billing the other. I own both,"Hi .


I'll get right to it. I have a trucking company it's incorporated in Ontario I do all the driving and take a large salary from it. My wife does some paper work , minor stuff etc and takes a small income based off hours worked. (Approx 12k a year)


I just opened up a number Ontario corporation.  To rent out generators and some other equipment to other trucking companies and also some tools and possibly other items not related to trucking.

Anyways my wife is going run this one. main sales person, invoices , orders etc etc.


My main question is my trucking company is going to be one of its customers for generator rentals for sure. If not it's main customer.


Is there any issues with the fact I own both companies? Having one invoice the other.


Also this almost seams like an income splitting loop hole here because my wife might draw a bunch of money from this new corporation if my trucking one rents alot from it.

US citizen working in Canada looking to invest. RRSP or IRA ? Other options?,"Hey everyone, 

I've been working in Canada for about 3 years (with a permit) and have had my eyes set on investing. With the pandemic I decided to push it and put as much as I can in savings.

With all the craziness of the stock market (especially on reddit) I've decided to start looking into it again.

From what I have gathered from the sub, TFSAs and RESPs aren't great for US citizens as they can be taxed by the IRS. I am leaning toward the IRA as I don't plan to retire in Canada, but will be here for at least for another 2-3 years. 

1. When it comes to making investments, which saving plan would be best for my situation? 
2. I read somewhere that it is possible to roll RRSPs into US retirement accounts (IRA, 401(k-b), would this be viable option with me staying in Canada?
3. As I am a US citizen, should I be investing with a service like Robinhood, or should I stick to a Canadian services like Wealthsimple?
4. (a total noob question) Is it possible to invest without any of these accounts? If so I am guessing the taxes would be harsh? 

Thanks and apologies if my understanding is off, I'm a bit fuzzy with all of this.",1,1611883921.0,2021,2021-01-28,Investing,levisRrt,1,l7fbca

"Investing in US stocks, TFSA or RRSP if I'm on Disability Assistance?","I'm unable to work, so I'm only getting about $14,820/yr on BC PWD assistance.

I also might qualify for the DTC (Disability Tax Credit) soon, which is $8,576 as of 2020.

If I invest in US stocks in my TFSA, will I be better off than the eventual tax on the RRSP, even though I would pay the 15% US withholding tax in the TFSA?

If I qualify for the DTC, I could open up an R(D\*)SP, but I don't know if I'll live another 30 years to take advantage of the government benefit.

My goal is to afford a downpayment on a home, and so the Home buyers plan through the RRSP would let me withdraw up to 35K early, and I'm wondering if I could avoid paying back into it and escape the tax consequences if I have the DTC. Also I might be required to reapply for the DTC and I see no reason why I wouldn't qualify a second time because my condition is unlikely to get better, but the government and doctors can be real assholes and make you jump through as many hoops as they want

21 year old money advice,"Hello fellow Canadians,

I like to explain my situation short and simple. I am currently a 21 year old undergrad student and looking into changing my current spending habits/saving habits. Im currently working a part-time job in telecommunications and make roughly 1200$ every month. My only expense is my monthly phone bill and my car insurance because my car is paid off making it roughly 180$ in bills. I have not taken a student loan because I can afford my semesters through my current part time job.

Now I am searching for some trips and tricks that some of you use to increase your savings and spending and what should I aim in saving per month. While writing this I feel like I should have the answers in front of me but I feel like im missing something that could help me out. Also, would like to hear what mistakes you guys have made that I should keep an eye on and what are some things you guys would have wished on picking up earlier (investing, savings, day to day spending).

Anybody losing faith in the brokerages after today?,"While 99% of my portfolio is ETF, for the first time ever, I don't feel comfortable with investing after the fiasco today. I suddenly realized that all these brokerages do have the power to restrict how we use our money when the odds are not in their favour. All it takes is an order from upper management.

Imagine the day you need to cash out for retirement, and the SELL button just becomes grey. That scenario is not impossible, it did happen today with GME, the only difference was it's the BUY button.

In fact, the Chairman of Interactive Broker just went on CNBC and said he would only allow people to trade when GME returns to $17.

If these brokerages can restrict GME today, then apparently they can do the same thing to VGRO down the road.

Continue credit counselling or do a consumer proposal,"Hi everyone this is my first time posting and I'm in a dilemma and can use the help.

Two years ago on advice from a friend I decided to go into credit counselling with this credit counselling company called x-bankers (I did some research and they havd 5 star rating and over 150 solid reviews and mt friend said they were great) so I went in and signed with $21,000 dollars in debt all unsecured high interest rate loans as soon as I did the CRA came and wanted $10,000 that I owed them in taxes as k didn't file for over ten years and previously I was working two jobs for a while. (I fucked up hard) so I decided to join this credit counselling company to see if they could help me (they kinda did, kinds didn't) they added a $3700 dmp fee (debt management fee plus a setup fee includesd) and they withheld my payments for money mart for three months and didn't pay them so that they would sign the agreements. I currently have four creditors signed with my credit counselling agency (fairstone, easy financial, money mart and cash money) I have a credit card for $1500 that I don't have under credit counselling. 

Two years later I am now at about $18,000 remaining on my total debt $15,000 for the credit counselling and $3800 remaining for the CRA and I noticed on my credit report that moneymart has been reporting to TransUnion as delinquent and it appears that they have not recieved a payment from me since December 2019. Easy financial is reporting in credit counselling unsecured, cash money doesn't report to the credit bureaus  and fairstone reported like nothing happened that I'm not in credit counselling. 

I spoke to my credit counsellor about money mart and he suggested that I withdraw my shares at the bank I worked at and gave him the money so that he can negotiate with moneymart and get rid of the negative reporting and continue with credit counselling as I'm half way through the program and should be done within a year or two and not all of my creditors are reporting negatively but I also do not know if I can trust this company, I feel like they are in it to take advantage of people who have made mistakes in the past that they knew exactly how money mart works and that they knew they would be an issue and they are trying to get me to settle so they can settle with money mart for pennies on the dollar and pocket the rest of the money for themselves on top of there hefty dmp fee. 

And I spoke to a trustee who said I should save my money do a consumer proposal negotiate it for like $4000 pay it off in four months and call it a day. I may have to pay off my credit card in full and close it which I do not want to do as I work for a bank and have a good credit card interest rate and do not want my employer to know that I filed a consumer proposal (I work for BMO) and the fear of this affecting me in the future scared me even if I can pay this off in a few months (I am currently giving my credit counselling company $800 a month for the debt and can afford $1000 a month to pay of this proposal early) 


Can any of you offer me suggestions, I don't know if I want to continue with the credit counselling company I kinda feel like it is a scam but weary of the consumer proposal.

19 year old looking for some banking advice.,"Alright to preface I'm a 19 year old living at home with parents. I have no car, no bills other than phone, no debt (haven't decided on school yet), and I have about $12000 sitting in my chequings account.

After going down the finance rabbit hole it seems clear to me that at this age I should be building an emergency fund to last me for 6 months that will stay in a High Interest Savings Account for safe keeping and to generate interest. I currently bank with Scotiabank but all of their interest rates are pretty garbage in comparison to the online banks like Tangerine or EQ so I think I would like to open a savings account with one of them. This has also led me to notice that Scotiabank really has no benefit to me as a bank other than having access to branches. Although I've only ever been to my branch once, I don't use cheques, I imagine they'll start slapping me with fees once I turn a certain age. This has led me to the question of would it be better for me to move my chequings to something like Tangerine, and save with a bank like EQ or a credit union like Meridian? Or would it be more advantageous to stay with Scotia for chequings and the benefits I may use in the future with access to branches and open a savings account with another bank?

Bonds,All the classic investing material tells you to keep a balance between stocks and bonds for a safe long term investment. Is there even any point with today's interest rates?

TFSA Question,"Lately I heard people recommending against “day trading” in a TFSA , in terms of what that entails seems very vague (like how many trades in a year ?). 

Here is my question:
1) wouldn’t day trading need to be in addition to withdrawing the profits from those trades out of your TFSA ? If someone is lets say making a few trades a day (normal buying/selling) not withdrawing any money from TFSA then its not considered income. From what it seems is CRA wants to discourage people using TFSA as a sheltered income with no tax, but in order for day trading to be income the person must also be withdrawing their profits. Same case for registered accounts, nothing is considered income until you withdraw funds then its taxed (buying and selling and not withdrawing is not income)

Wouldn’t this be the correct way to define that? Day trading plus withdrawing the profits is income as a business not just passive sometime several trades a day with no withdrawals from TFSA.",6,1611871012.0,2021,2021-01-28,,Calm_Ad8206,0,l7a56m

Making a first post. Been lurking for the last weeks and long time lurker on Reddit as a whole. I figured it would be an apt time to post as I sit on the sidelines watching market madness.

Sufficient buying power is required for this account type.""

Am I eligible for the Lifelong Learning Plan if I'm collecting OSAP?,"Long post below, so here's a TLDR with my main questions:

1. Am I eligible for the Lifelong Learning Plan even though I'm collecting OSAP (received my last payment earlier this month if that means anything)? I graduate this July.

2. Is it possible to repay OSAP with LLP, and if so is that even smart to do? 

3. Would it be smarter to borrow from my Tangerine line of credit than to borrow from my RRSP? For background info, I basically have the Canadian Couch Potato TD e-series index fund portfolio, and I adjust the funds 2-3 times a year if that. 

My situation is a little weird. I'm enrolled in an 11-month private career college in Ontario which started in September 2020 and will end in July 2021. The tuition was ~32,000$ for the year all in. I received about 20,000$ from OSAP with 4,000$ of that being a grant I don't have to pay back. 

I'm starting to run low on funds and I just happened to come across the Lifelong Learning Plan. I'm wondering if I should have just used that instead of OSAP, but I'm also wondering if I'm still eligible for it now? I have roughly 21,000$ in an RRSP and I'd love to be able to borrow from that to get me through the rest of the year and maybe even help me pay back some of the OSAP loans once I graduate if that makes sense to do so. I opened a 20,000$ line of credit with Tangerine as a safety net for this year, but haven't dipped into it yet. Would that be better to borrow from?

My living arrangements have been extremely cheap thus far thanks to a friend, but that might change soon and my rent might go from 250$ to over 1,000$ a month, which is why I'm starting to think about my financial options.",7,1611863340.0,2021,2021-01-28,Debt,Teejay55,2,l76ouu
Smith Manoeuvre: Are you actually allowed to borrow from the HELOC to pay the interest?,"The [terms](https://www.scotiabank.com/content/dam/scotiabank/canada/en/documents/mortgages/solicitor-forms/personal_credit_agreement_companion_booklet_lc.pdf) for the Scotia STEP product (bottom of PDF page 29) say:

""You agree that you will not make payments on your credit account using funds borrowed from Scotiabank or drawn on any other credit account""

I thought this is exactly what you're supposed to do in Smith. Is this a quirk with Scotia? Are other HELOCs like this? Do people just ignore this clause?

\*\* Edit \*\*

Thanks everyone. It's still unclear if using the HELOC this way is allowed by Scotia. But assuming it *is* allowed, I found some info to explain the tax deductibility based on your replies and some Googling. Here's the relevant part of the Income Tax Act ([Section 20(1)(d)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-3.3/section-20.html)). It lists payment amounts that are eligible for the tax deduction. Here it says:

\*""\****Compound interest*** *(d) an amount paid in the year pursuant to a legal obligation to pay interest on an amount that would be deductible under paragraph 20(1)(c) if it were paid in the year or payable in respect of the year;""*

It's basically saying that interest on tax-deductible-interest is also tax deductible. Here's my interpretation (via an hypothetical example) of why borrowing from a HELOC to pay its own interest qualifies as ""interest on interest"" in the Smith Manoeuvre.

Month 1: HELOC borrowing limit = $0

Month 2: HELOC borrowing limit grows by $1000. You borrow $1000 to invest.

Month 3: HELOC borrowing limit grows by $1010. Interest charge for Month 2 is $10. You borrow $1000 to invest. You borrow $10 and pay Month 2's interest charge.

Month 4: HELOC borrowing limit grows by $1020. Interest charge for Month 3 is $20. You borrow $1000 to invest. You borrow $20 to pay Month 3's interest charge.

The Tax Act clearly says that any ""amounts"" paid to service interest on an investment loan are tax deductible. Therefore the $10 payment in Month 3 qualifies.

In Month 4, the $20 interest charge is a combination of interest on a $2000 investment loan and interest on $10 of deductible interest.

Section 20(1)(d) says this latter portion is also tax deductible.

I also found [this](https://myreinspace.com/threads/does-anybody-capitalize-the-interest-on-their-heloc.5112/) forum post from 2008 where someone pasted the text from the original Smith Manoeuvre book. The book author cited the same passage.

Selling a car at a loss or waiting?,"TLDR: Car loan is $11,500. Market so far is offering $9k. Do I take the hit now or wait? I’m moving to Toronto soon and won’t be needing it.

Hey PFC,

I’m needing your advice on a car loan situation. I bought a 2016 VW Golf in 2017...long story short, I’m financing it over way too long of a period (2024) and am now wanting to sell to go car free.

There’s approximately $11,500 left on the loan with one not at fault accident (which I believe is hurting the resale price).

The cars on the market now and the highest offers I’ve gotten are around 9k at most.

I spend $470 (292 + 180) on the loan and insurance. I’m trying to do a cost/benefit analysis to see if it’s worth taking the hit right now and starting to save the almost $500/month going forward.

With everything going on the market right now, I’m wanting opinions on timings, cost advantages to waiting, etc.

Stuck on finances and moving....what should we do?!,"I'm so stuck with what to do!!  Please someone give me some advice.  I read all these posts on here with 50+ comments, and I get one/two responses on a post.   Please help! 

Currently live in small town Ontario.  Bought our house 8 years ago on Power of Sale and got a huge century home & land cheap.  We've done a lot of work to it and now it's just too much for us being just 2 (originally had his 2 kids with us as well--grown up and out now)  Husband and I both work 1 hr away in City, however, I've been off for 2 years for some medical issues, and now am returning to work next week.  We've been discussing moving closer to work since house prices are great for selling (would make about 300k profit) but opposite for buying.  We are 10-15 years away from retirement.  We are barely at home, and the house/property is just too much for 2 of us (first world problems!) 

We both make 100k. We have good pensions, some small investments and a cottage with a VTB mortgage of 260,000 at 3.64% with 3 years left on it.  We're looking at moving with in 20 min commute to work and a closer commute to the cottage (we go every possible chance).  He commutes 5/week.   I will be gradually working up to 5 days, but with the varied time/hours, we won't be able to commute together for 3-6 months.  So two cars doing 60+k commuting (1 hour each way=4 hours a day).   After 6 months, it might be possible for us to work the same hours and commute.  The closer we get to city/work, the higher the price of the house.   We're trying to stay below 525,000!!

So here's my dilemma.  To sell or not to sell---AND If we sell the house (for what we expect) what do with the 300k profit??  

Option 1--Put down on new house.  Reduce mortgage payment, no mortgage insurance and some equity into property.  Basically keep all payments same as there are now with a shorter commute.

Option2--Put down on Cottage.   Spoken to vendor.  It's a fixed 5 year term, and he won't let me break it without a considerable penalty (haven't discussed terms, but online it suggest 10-15k).   Over the course of the next 3 years, I have calculated interest payments to be 25k--which would be gone if I paid it outright.  Eliminate this monthly payment from my overall budget at this (currently high) interest rate.   This payment would be absorbed into the new house mortgage amount---still paying less then I would be with the two separate.  

Option 3-Save/Invest the profit, use it to pay off the cottage for monthly payments and annual 15% payment option and basically pay it off at the end of the 3 years without paying the penalty of option 2, but loose 25k in interest paid out over the remaining term.   Where to stock pile the profit?  We both have TSFA, but mine is maxed and he only has about 80k room. Neither of us put in RRSPs, and would need access to the funds for monthly/yearly payout.   \*\*\*Retirement plan is to sell everything and live at the cottage year round--so my priority has been to pay this off \*\*\*

Option 4--Stay put.   Deal with the commute, hopefully works out to commute together (so really no change from the last 2 years).  This is my least favourable option, but the least complicate, familiar and safe bet.  

Please send me some guidance.

 *\[We are Canada’s national statistical agency. We are here to engage with Canadians and provide them with high-quality statistical information that matters!\]*   


\*\*\*

  
En 2017, plus de 2 millions de Canadiens de 15 ans et plus ont déclaré avoir une incapacité liée à la santé mentale, et un peu plus du cinquième (21,2 %) de ces personnes vivait dans un ménage considéré comme ayant un besoin impérieux en matière de logement.

Lorsque l’on parle de santé mentale, chaque geste compte, maintenant plus que jamais. À l’occasion de la journée Bell Cause pour la cause, nous partagerons aujourd’hui quelques renseignements sur les répercussions de la COVID-19 sur la santé mentale des Canadiens.

Depuis le début de la COVID-19, le nombre de jeunes Canadiens déclarant avoir une excellente ou une très bonne santé mentale a diminué, passant de 60 % avant la COVID-19 à 40 % en juillet 2020. Les plus fortes baisses ont été observées chez les jeunes. [https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-631-x/2020004/s3-fra.htm](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-631-x/2020004/s3-fra.htm)

An (Illiterate) American in (Financial) Canada Help,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some /personalfinancecanada advice. I am an American currently pursuing my doctoral degree in Canada. Thankfully, my income is healthy (thank you scholarships) and I am able to live within my means comfortably. 

I split my scholarship and work deposits into a checking and savings account, but I’d like my “money to work for me,” as they say. I’ve heard much about TFSA’s as a possible way to invest, but have no clue if it’s the right move. 

Since I’ve been throwing my head in books since, well, starting school, I am as financially illiterate as they come. I really can’t do much in the States, given that I don’t make income over there, and I would like to leave myself in the best possible financial position when I finish my degree (and hopefully return back to the States with a bit of financial breathing room). 

How should I manage my extra income? To give you all background:

I have an emergency fund to last a year (rent, utilities, and groceries).

I am hoping to finish my degree in 2 years, but with COVID and the job market, it may take a year longer. (Can I contribute to a TFSA through my bank with the expectation of withdrawing so soon?)

I’ve paid Canadian taxes since I’ve moved here a few years ago.

B/c of the PhD, I won’t be able to devote and pay much attention to specific investments. What would be the safest and least burdensome investment types during these times? 

Regarding my American financial status:

\- Since I am a resident of Canada as a full-time student, I do not make any income in the US and do not qualify paying taxes. 

Is it even possible for me at all to contribute to a TFSA? What do you all think?

I apologize for my complete naiveté at this. Any advice and help would be very much appreciated!",8,1611846411.0,2021,2021-01-28,Investing,snowytrees3405,2,l6z25l

If my account shows a Combined Total of CAD**6,000.00** USD**4,686.22** ... but the money is currently on the CAD side.... do I need to convert it first (either bite the bullet with the rate or do NG with DLR/DLR.U and hope it closes quick) or if I go to buy a stock can I specify it to use the USD value (and it does the currency exchange as part of the purchase)?

Can a Bank Manager Relabel an Account?,"Hi PFC,

I opened a savings account online but had to go in to sign the docs. The docs listed a chequing account but the bank manager said not to worry.  With her pen, she crossed out the account listed and rewrote the name of the account I initially applied for. Days later, I logged into my online banking and noticed that the account is still listed as a chequing account. She insists it is a savings account and maybe on her end it is, but on my end its not.

My concern is that in a month from now, I'm going to be charged for a chequing account that I didn't ask for. Should I take the manager's word? Or should I press them to correct it?   If I'm charged for the account can I argue that its not what I applied for, even though I did sign the docs?

RRSP Mutual Funds and High MER (Ontario),"Hey all, 

So I'm 32 and have just begun learning about my money and where it is going. Over the years I have managed to accumulate ~$18,000 in RRSP mutual funds through TD. Now that I've begun learning about what I'm actually buying, I'm sure most of you will not be surprised to hear the MER were well over 2%.

This money will likely by used as a down-payment, but realistically not for another 5 years. What I would like to do is move it into a self-managed TD Direct Investing account. I've seen the e-series index funds mentioned here frequently and I like the benefits they offer, despite the slightly higher MERs you might see in ETFs. 

This is where my confusion set in. 
I know I can create a TD DI account, and I believe I can transfer the assets of my RRSP into this DI account. Can I then sell or cash in the mutual funds I have, and re-invest them as I see fit, without getting hammered with taxes related to capital gains or penalties for selling something in my RRSP?

Voluntary disclosure on personal taxes - tax lawyer yes or no?,"So I know someone close to me that likely needs to file a voluntary disclosure for personal taxes.

Seeing as they got into a mess by not consulting with a pro, I feel they should start fixing things by doing so. But they won't do it themselves, so it'll be up to me to find the lawyer for them and give reasons why they should engage with one (aside from, ""let's talk to a pro about this, stop bugging me about it, repeating yourself for literally the 20th time, and let's actually do something productive about the situation"").

So what are the do's and don't's of hiring a tax lawyer? What should I be looking for in the qualifications? Is one needed for personal income tax voluntary disclosures?

If a tax lawyer is preferable, what arguments should I use for someone that is skittish and fearful about the whole situation and would just rather throw themselves into anxiety attack after anxiety attack? What can I say to get them to listen?

Buying a duplex in Montreal with my brother,"My brother (23m) and I (28f) want to join forces and get a place in Montreal. We are considering a duplex.

Pros:

\- I will live there; he is living in the states right now but might come back in a year or so

\- Based on various reports I read, plexes have a better rate of return than condos 

\- The renter could pay some of the mortgage

\- It's easy to find tenants

\- It's easy to sell after a couple of years 

&#x200B;

Cons:

\- have to deal with tenants

\- duplexes in Montreal are pretty old and hard to get

Gas hookup vs staying on hydro in BC,"Is it worth it to get a natural gas connection? 

Our place isn't that big, so the hydro bill on average is $60 per month. We also have a wood stove which helps cut power costs during winter.

Would we really be further ahead? Although our hydro bill would go down somewhat, wouldn't we be paying more altogether with two energy bills?

OSAP Repayment Assistance Stage 2,"Using a throwaway account because I'm a bit embarrassed, but I could use some advice/answers if anyone can help.   


I had about $20,000 OSAP debt when I graduated about 9 years ago and I have been on Repayment Assistance for much of the time since then. (I have been steadily working since then, and I keep my expenses low, and I have no other debt, but I have never yet earned enough monthly to be able to make the $250/month student loan payments.) Thanks to the huge help of Stage 2 of Repayment Assistance, my loan is down to about $13,000.

I understand that because of Stage 2 Repayment Assistance, I cannot get any more government student loans until my current one is fully paid off. My question is, if I manage to pay off the $13,000 in the next couple of years... THEN will I be able to apply for OSAP again to go back to school?

"I'm thinking after decades of waiting for shit to get better, it's time to cut the cord and move on.","I am realising all of a sudden the disadvantages of continuing to pay rent in order to share a 900 sq. foot house with a manipulative parent.
Up until today I saw every small annoyance that my Mom created as simply that, a small annoyance and I continued to think ""this person doesn't seem likely to cause me major and/or lasting psychological damage"". But I just realised on a spur of the moment that I don't need small annoyances constantly happening to me because all those small annoyances will add together, then compound into a very significant burden of stress and reduced efficiency on my part. Why should I settle for putting up with these annoyances just because I have a disability and I just ""don't really have anything better to do?"" And on this spur of the moment, I have realised that I would be much happier, and find much more fulfillment being completely free of anyone harrassing me or trying to run a dictatorship over my life or trying to gaslight me into thinking that because I have a disability I simply won't make it in the world on my own.

The plan I had was to remain on ODSP and simply put up with the small but annoying occurences, and use the extra space available to me for my hobbies, such as gardening, video gaming, self sufficiency practice, and growing my limit of 4 cannabis plants. (Yes, that's one of my hobbies.)

Now I would really like to move out and preferably, move AWAY somewhere I have never been and instead of living in a sea of helplessness and depression, get out and LIVE my fucking life.

I know this probably just sounds like a senseless rant, but my reason for posting it here is that I need advice on what the best course of action would be to begin on a path to financial independence if I were to make this major shift in my life.

I am on ODSP, I have about 1700 debt, (luckily owed to people who don't charge interest on it) ... and I plan one paying roughly 350 of it off as of next Wednesday.
I would be happy even just to live in a room in someone's house as long as it's far away from manipulation and attempts at brainwashing
I have quit my job before, due partly to the fact that I found fulltime work somewhat overwhelming, but I think mostly because my employer always seemed less than happy about the work I did, and I felt that seeing as they never bothered to mention that to me they didn't respect the fact that I have my own unique challenges.
But I am not above doing everything that I can to get my ass in gear and make my way back into the workforce even if it that process takes a couple years.

Any advice on this idea of starting anew and looking for new opportunities? Feel free to ask me anything you want to know for additional information, I know this whole post has been kind of vague but I'm feeling kind of stigmatized at the moment.",5,1611805311.0,2021,2021-01-27,,Zepphead80,0,l6n2ph

Manulife secured line of credit," 

Hello,

has anyone applied for and gotten the secured line of credit? I'd be interested to hear your experience. It seems like a superior way of borrowing money as opposed to going on margin, as you don't seem to be at risk of a margin call or having to top up additional funds. With Access line of credit or access line of credit plus, it seems like amazing option. I'm wondering why would anyone use margin at a bank when they can do this, with the only downside of having shares held in kind as collateral that can't be sold or moved unless the loan is paid off. But if you're borrowing to invest for the long run, you probably aren't going to be selling shares anyways. This seems like a no brainer to me, and an upgrade over the investment loan as they force that to be invested in mutual funds and ETFs created by Manulife:

"Warranties, Extended Warranties, and Appliances","Appliance tech here:

I thought I'd share my views and experiences on the world of appliances and their warranties. I started this trade at a company that was an authorized servicer that did both manufacturer and extended warranties. I am now running my own independent company that specializes in out-of-warranty calls so I'm someone who's been on both sides and seen all sorts of crazy stuff.

Let's start with manufacturer's warranties:

Appliances sold in Canada come with a 1 year manufacturer's warranty which protects against design and manufacturing defects. These are generally ""top to bottom"" warranties that will cover all parts and labour.

There are some caveats:

It is very uncommon for an appliance to break down in the first week or month. In almost all cases a warranty call was due to user or an installation error.

For example the worst case was when a washer's shipping bolts were not removed before use. These secure the drum against movement and if the washer is run with them still installed it will shake itself to death. This often led to broken dampers and cracked rear outer tubs. In the case of the latter the tub is $450-$550 and labour is very intensive, requiring 2-3 hours with an average labour rate of $300 or so. So it essentially wrote off the machine and it is not covered under the manufacturer's warranty.

&#x200B;

Despite the installation manual, despite bright coloured bolts and warning tags, this happened all the time. Often people would pay someone cash to install their washer (so no way to seek recourse), it would shake violently, and they'd call in a warranty claim. Almost every week I had to tell someone that their brand new washer was a write off and that they had no warranty coverage since they didn't install or have it installed correctly.

Another issue was that in the past manufacturer's would waive user errors as a courtesy. Recently in the past few years to tighten costs manufacturers started to no longer waive these calls and would demand payment.

For example if a dishwasher isn't draining in the majority of cases it is due to an obstruction such as a piece of bone. This is considered user error and I was told to demand payment. Given that a customer had no way to determine if a not draining issue was due to a piece of bone or a mechanical problem you can imagine the confrontation that would follow. So technicians would often lie and write in their report that it was due to a loose wire, etc. I remember the year this change came about there was a sudden explosion in ""loose wires"", ""improperly seated pumps"", etc. This way the customer got the call covered, the appliance was working again, and the manufacturer was none the wiser. But understand that a manufacturer or technician can 100% demand payment for these calls.

Read the installation and owner's manual cover to cover. They're written in layman's terms and the majority of owners won't even read them at all. Don't ever pay someone cash under the table to install an appliance or do it yourself it you're handy and can read a manual.

Next up, extended warranties:

Extended warranties are often associated with stupid business decisions. If you get the right extended warranty they are most certainly not stupid.

Appliances today break down at an incredible rate. Parts have high markup and they are largely not interchangeable to discourage third parties from flooding the market with generic parts. In fact with older appliances that's exactly what happened; older Whirlpool top load washers used the same lid switch and today you can get generic lid switches for $10 when the OEM counterpart retails for $120 or more.

It only takes a single service call to pay off the cost of a 5 year extended warranty. Often I'd run into a customer who's dryer's idler pulley failed a few weeks after the 1 year manufacturer's warranty expired and you could imagine the look of regret on their faces when they saw the quote.

There are some things to watch out for with extended warranties which differentiate them from manufacturer's warranties which as mentioned earlier are ""top to bottom"":

1.) Yearly limits:

Some extended warranties have a yearly limit. In one case a customer's extended warranty only provided coverage for $250/year. I had to break the news that their repair would cost $800 so they would have to pay $550 to proceed. They had no idea their extended warranty had a limit and they were livid to hear it.

2.) ""Cosmetic Parts"":

This is a particularly insidious clause that defines ""cosmetic parts"" as ""any part not directly related to the function of an appliance"". This included fridge crisper drawers and shelves. So a customer's fridge's crisper drawer could be cracked in half, they can't close the door properly without removing it altogether, and it's not covered by their extended warranty. Fridge drawers, shelves, and other plastic interior parts break all the time and can cost hundreds to replace, plus labour. Make sure the extended warranty covers ALL parts.

3.) Food Spoilage:

Some dealers and extended warranties provide coverage for food spoilage if a fridge breaks down. The catch is that they will reimburse you a fixed amount via a gift card at a selected grocery store, usually to a limit of $250. For the most part this is a worthwhile deal. If your milk/meat/etc has been sitting at +13°C instead of the usual +3°C don't risk it and toss it out.

4.) Third Parties:

Dealers such as Best Buy sell extended warranties but it's through Geek Squad, but in reality it's from a company called Assurant. The problem is that this longer chain increases turn around time. Often I'd have to get Assurant to authorize a part which meant I could not arrive on the first call with the part I believed was most likely associated with their call. This is called ""triaging"" in the trade. Say a washer isn't draining - I would order a drain pump and did my best to arrive with it for the first call. Sometimes I couldn't because it would take too long to ship. If I don't need the pump, say because the not draining was due to a sock, I'd return the pump with no restocking fee.

With third party coverage it was harder to get the part and I'd often have to come back on a second call to install it. These are called ""parts in"" calls. But keep in mind that anything can cause any issue that can't be predicted such as faulty wiring, a faulty board, etc. It's always an educated guess and a game of percentages.

So try to find extended warranties from the dealer itself when possible.

5.) 5/10 Year Manufacturer's Warranties:

You'll sometimes see these labels on the front of an appliance. Read the fine print and you'll see that they only cover very specific parts and rarely if ever cover labour. For example a washer's 10 year drive warranty may cover the motor, belt, etc but won't cover labour. If there's a dryer stacked on top of the washer you'll need to pay for two technicians to take it down unless you do it yourself.

Another issue is that this may not necessarily address systemic design flaws. In the case of LG linear compressors they fail after 3 years and the warranty call would install the same faulty compressor only to fail again within another 3 years. Before you buy any appliance Google the appliance and add ""lawsuits"". This is why I tell all of my customers to avoid LG and Samsung at all costs. At my first company I was expressly cautioned against informing customers of lawsuits. This was one of the reasons I left the company to go off on my own.

6.) Lemon Clause:

A lemon clause will replace the appliance completely if 3 separate visits don't address the issue. In reality dealers and manufacturers will do everything in their power to resist exchanging a unit. It was madness; I did so many calls that clearly exceeded the cost of the appliance but I was told to keep going. We call this ""Plato's Boat"" in the trade. ""Plato's Boat"" is a thought experiment: Say two people have the exact same wooden boat each. Suppose they take a piece of their boat and exchange it for a piece on the other boat. At what point is it still their boat?

I've replaced entire washer tubs, control boards, and entire wiring harnesses over many calls with many irate customers wondering why the hell they won't just replace the entire appliance. If it was the same issue I was told to keep trying different fixes as it would be considered a different type of repair so as to not trigger the 3 visit clause.

Read the ""lemon clause"" carefully. There are many sneaky clauses that they will use to avoid exchanging or god forbid refunding an appliance.

7.) Credit Cards:

Some credit cards offer extended warranties if you purchase the appliance through them. These are often less expensive than other extended warranties and in my experience more generous.

I hope this helps, and hit me up if you have any further questions! With more and more people at home they're breaking their appliances at increasing rates. I've never been busier (I have extremely strict safety protocols including wearing PAPRs (Powered Air Purifying Respirators). I'm running into more and more desperate customers who can barely or cannot afford repairs on their appliances, and more and more customers who's appliance broke shortly after the 1 year manufacturer's warranty.

Extended warranties are often well worth it if you do your homework and read the fine print. Sure, you may go the entire 5 years without ever needing it, but your car has airbags that will almost never go off, right? But you'd sure as hell want them anyway.

Edit: Holy smokes, I wasn't expecting this level of response, thanks!

I am glad I was able to help others and share some insight into this industry. I was planning some more posts so I will follow up with a guide to buying appliances, how appliance repair works, and the trade itself. Stay tuned!

Edit 2: Wow, this is keeps going!

Question about Questrade settling USD trades into CAD,"In my TFSA I purchased US equities and did not convert my original funds from CAD to USD prior to purchasing. I sold the equities and now have USD sitting as cash in my account. I have my preferences set to “settle in CAD” in account settings.

My question is, how much am I going to be hit with in terms of fees overnight when my USD gets automatically converted to CAD by Questrade? 

I keep seeing something to the effect of 1.99% fee, but I’m not entirely sure if this is accurate.

E.g. - if I had 1500USD would that be converted according to the BoC rate and then Questrade takes a 1.99% cut afterward? 

Thanks in advance everyone.",4,1611797296.0,2021,2021-01-27,,ynwa1077,0,l6kcv4

Put extra student loans into TFSA?,"I am a graduate student in a good field and have approximately 70-80k of student loan debt. However, I won’t have to pay any of it back for over a year, as I am still in school until December and have 6 months of grace period after that (I live in Alberta).

I am a decent saver and tend not to use all of my student loans each year, but always apply for extra student loans the next year just in case. Currently I have ~10k extra that I don’t expect I’ll touch before I am done my program (even more if I reapply before my final semester in September).

Once I am done school, I hope to figure out a budget and set aside an emergency fund. Then I want to toss all extra money straight to student loans in one large lump sum when I finish, and as much as possible from each pay check.

SO. My question is:

I have a lot of money that is currently just sitting in my bank account unused and it feels like a waste. Should I be investing it? Or is that dumb if I may need to pull it out after a year to help pay off my student loans? I’ve been thinking about TFSA in Wealthsimple. Any other options?

Also, should I be getting more student loans in September? Or is it unwise to get more if I don’t need it, even if I am a good saver and will just repay whatever I don’t use before the interest period?

I am definitely new at all of this but know I don’t want so much money just sitting there unused. Thanks in advance!",6,1611797045.0,2021,2021-01-27,Investing,pajamasam09,2,l6k9ob

Looking for advice about possibly moving money from spousal RRSP into TFSA.,"I am a stay at home parent and therefore have zero income. My husband has contributed into a spousal RRSP for a number of years. I am wondering about withdrawing from the spousal RRSP an amount low enough to remain tax free and putting it into a TFSA. I have the room. Currently we are maximizing our RRSP’s plus using catch up room every year though do have TFSA room. I do think eventually we will have extra money to put into a TFSA but I don’t anticipate it for at least 2-3 years as we continue to invest in our business. Interested to know if anyone thinks this would be advisable for us. Thanks.

Is it Normal for Bank account to require credit report after opening,"Hi

I was looking to open a simplii Chequing bank account. Was looking for something cheap that will accept international money wires.

When signing up online they have this clause (below), whic seems a bit suspicious to me. I assumed they would have to do a credit check to open the account, but find it odd that they should be able to do it as they feel. I worry this will affect my Credit Score. 

This was the clause for Credit Bureau Authorization:

 ""I consent to Simplii Financial from time to time obtaining my credit, financial and related personal or business information, including a consumer or credit bureau report about me from, and disclosing this information to, any credit or consumer reporting agency or any third party that I have had or may have a financial relationship with.

My consent is effective immediately and is valid as long as I have the product or service and for a reasonable time thereafter.

"Paid off home, best way to finance a 2nd property for personal use?","Hi PFCers,

I became mortgage free this summer, after 5 years of aggressive payments, and paying cash for major renovations before that.  I really don't want to borrow money again.   But, due to personal, family, & life reasons -- a recreation property makes a lot of sense, for the present and the decades to come.

I'm trying to figure out the best way to borrow money for this.  Here are my parameters:

\-My timeline for purchase could be between next month to the next couple of years

\-My budget could range quite a bit depending on what comes up

\-I will pay it off using a combination of large monthly payments, and major annual balloon payments

\-I will likely pay it off in anywhere between 2-4 years.

\-I need to come in with condition free / cash offers to get a chance of getting what we want

\-I like a low minimum payment for optionality

From my initial research a HELOC seems to make the most sense, and the Tangerine looks a great option.  What does PFC think?  I'm completely new to them, but have been doing some initial learning.

Buying us Stocks/ETF,"Hi,

First time that I'm doing Norbert's gambit. Would appreciate some advice on specific questions. 

I use Questrade. 

I put some CAD into an RRSP. And plan to buy some US stocks/ETF. I will be holding and selling when I make gains. But won't actually take out the cash in CAD until I retire, so not worried about taxes.

I'm more uncertain the US currency part. 

So I realized I already lost lots of money on exchange fees so I'm going to do Norbert's gambit. I found easy to follow instructions to buy DLR.TO, journal, then sell DLR.U.TO, so I'm ok there.

Specific Question:
Once I sell DLR.U.TO, do I need to make sure that my ""currency settlement"" is ""currency of transaction""? If ""currency settlement"" is just ""CAD"", if I sell the DLR.U.TO, does it just get converted back into CAD?
 
Broader Question:
Is ""currency settlement"" = ""currency of transaction"" just the best default? 

For example, If I deposit USD into my account, will ""currency settlement"" = ""currency of transaction"" ensure that my USD stays as USD buying power?

Also, when I eventually sell the US stock, will ""currency settlement"" = ""currency of transaction"" ensure that my USD stays as USD?


Also is there anything else I need to be aware of? Or any other settings on Questrade to adjust?

Advice on handling excess amount from DB/DC plan windup by company [ON company; QC resident],"Hi folks, per the title, my company (HQ in Ontario; I live and work in Quebec) is closing out pension plans (both DB/DC) and replacing them with a profit sharing plan. All has been discussed and agreed (you can imagine the fun we had there) 


Now that it;s being executed, I am faced with a decision on what to do with ""excess"". It's not a huge amount (under 4k ) but I was asked to confirm where i wanted it deposited after final calculation and tax. Looking into how these things are handled, I understand i can elect to take it as cash (taxed at special rate ; unsure what that would be , more on that later) or have it transferred into an existing RRSP.

I do have room in RRSP contributions (generally means i put in tfsa not rrsp). Looking into what the tax would be  i couldnt find something specific other than [FORM RC359](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc359.html) which, if actually the right view, means that i would be taxed 33% of the amount (as a resident of Quebec)

If that rate is correct and my marginal tax rate is higher, am i better off taking the ""post tax cash"" then putting it into the RRSP myself or just have them transfer the whole amount directly.

I'm currently with CIBC and also just started a mutual funds account, but I'd like to go a bit deeper. I've seen lots of reviews on WealthSimple Trade but not heard much about CIBC's Investor's Edge. 

Any recommendations or thoughts on any of those two? I narrowed it down to both give me experience with both CIBC and regular WealthSimple account.

Investing for poor-wealthy noobs... Help?,"Hi PFC. Hoping you guys can point me in the right direction re: investing. I have already read the wiki. 

To start, I am a complete investing noob. I have 30k in various “envelope” savings accounts with Tangerine. I have no debt (except mortgage), no car payments. Freaky about budgeting. Love tracking my money. That being said I do not make a ton of money, I am an apprentice Electrician, but I am childfree and so is my partner. I made 77k pre-tax in 2020 (my best year yet). My job is very (... how to say...) not steady. I worked pretty steady almost all of last year (with the exception of April where I was laid off b/c of Covid), but this year so far I have not worked a day, and probably won’t until mid-Feb at the earliest. I like having a large safety net (hence the 30k in cash) in case I go long stretches without working. 

In 2017 my grandfather passed and left me with $50,000. My parents recommended they start a tfsa with their guy, at CIBC wood gundy. I believe that because my parents have a lot of wealth invested with these guys and therefore (not 100% about this) their kids (me) get lower fees or something like that. 

In CIBC I have 30K spread across 6 different mutual funds, and I had 20k in GICs that matured in March of 2020, which have since just been sitting there in cash. 

I do not currently have an RRSP open (but I do have \~3k sitting in an old company's pension plan, planning on moving that over to an RRSP soon. But where?). 

My main question for you guys, is where should I invest my money? Do I stay with “mom and dads guy”? Should I open my RRSP with Wood Gundy? I’ve read about some questrade nightmares on here and that makes me hesitate. Why would Wealthsimple be better than who I’m with right now? 

I know that the wiki says to fill up TFSA room first, but a turbotax calculator says if I dump 5g into an RRSP this year ill get a $4k+ return. Isn't that better? 

I am super risk-averse. Risk literally paralyzes me. In 2014 my ex was huge into day trading crypto, and he lost over 10g. I loaned him 6 to get it back, and he did, and I got my money back, but it still terrifies me. 

That being said, I also realize that if I had taken my 20 liquid cash in March and invested in TSLA I’d be laughing. 

 I am afraid to do the wrong thing but I also know that doing nothing is worse.

TLDR:  PFC, help me balance this Fomo/hindsight and my risk fear. Who should manage my money and where should my money go? I could ask CIBC/my parents these questions but obvi they're biased. 

If you need more info comment and I’ll try to answer.",9,1611776722.0,2021,2021-01-27,Investing,MapleDayDreams,0,l6cmwc

My bank has offered my a personal line of credit, but I don't know much about them. It seems like a better option for borrowing short term instead of putting a large expense on a credit card since the interest rate is much lower. Here is my main question: 

\- I won't be charged so long as I don't use it? Meaning I can just use it to finance largish purchases or if I need emergency money

I'm a new homeowner, and although we have some money leftover after the DP and closing fees, it's not as much savings as we're used to.

Affordable cities,"Hello PFC, 

My spouse and I are currently living in Newfoundland, I'm from a small town in NL and she is originally from Toronto. We've been living in a smaller city with an aging population of ~20k but have always wanted to go somewhere bigger with more to offer. Originally we visited Toronto and wanted to move there, but quickly realized just how expensive it would be. From there, we have mainly been looking at Halifax and St. John's NL. 

Are there any other cities that we should look at, in or East of Ontario, and excluding Quebec? 

Dartmouth seemed more affordable, until we visited and realized it is very old and run down, and it did not feel safe at all compared to Halifax.

Advice for my Father in Law on the death of his wife,"We will be speaking with a probate lawyer about the estate but wanted to focus on this part for now. My retired father in law recently (late 2020) withdrew 100k from his RRSP in cash as he was anticipating some expenses relating to his wife's health care. His wife has since died (in January 2021).  We didn't have a chance to council him on this and he just sort of went ahead and did it. We now expect that he might get hit with a big tax bill based on the withdrawal as it will count as income. What can he do at this point to reduce his tax implications based on this RRSP withdrawal? 

Put it back?

Income split with his wife (recently deceased)?

Convert the cash to a RRIF?

Looking for a new investing brokerage,"Good day,

&#x200B;

I have been doing my investing with RBC direct investing, at first it was to get a multi product rebate, but upon doing some research I realize all I need to do is have a balance of 500$ in that account to qualify. Obviously, now I am looking for a lower cost alternative to RBCDI as 9.95 commission per trade is pretty steep comparitvely. 

&#x200B;

I'm somewhat familiar with my options, although forgive me if I'm neglecting something - Questrade and Wealthsimple. My overall investing strategy is more interested in long term, relatively safe stock investments that will help compound my savings over time, although I am also interested in options trading here and there and if I see an opportunity to do a little day trading and make a little cash sometimes, may as well. At some point, I may look to invest in some ETFs but I am little behind in research in that department.

&#x200B;

Obviously the zero commision structure of Wealthsimple is attractive, but makes me wonder what I am missing out on by using their service. I'm not interested in roboinvestors as I do my own trading, and I seem to remember reading about how certain commodities of trading were unavailable with Wealthsimple, can anyone provide some insight as to what I'll be missing out on using them over Questrade?

Contributing to RRSP to owe negative taxes,"~~So I just made a bit of a mistake here. After a previous RRSP contribution, I was in a position where I would owe about 5k in taxes. However, I made a mistake and contributed another 10k to my RRSP. So effectively I'll owe -5k in taxes if I'm not mistaken. I couldn't find a way to cancel my contribution, and it seems like if I pull it out now I'll have to pay about 30% on it.~~

~~Does anyone have any experience with RRSP contributions causing negative tax owed? Will that be carried over to 2021? Or will the government send me a check for 5k? Anything else to consider in this situation? I had enough contribution room in my RRSP, so that's not a concern. I'm mostly just bummed that I've seemingly spoiled 5k worth of contribution room.~~

Edit: I may have explained this poorly. If I made 25k this year self employed, and contributed 30k to my RRSP, is that extra 5k just a squandered RRSP contribution? Is it carried over?

Edit 2: I was definitely thinking about my RRSP and taxes owed wrong, and seem to have annoyed a number of people. I'm sorry about that.",18,1611676122.0,2021,2021-01-26,,gonegazing,0,l5gnth
Looking to acquire landscaping franchise in my sector. Is my plan viable?,"Hi,

I've recently gained interest in acquiring a franchise in the sector that I work which is landscaping for the following reasons:

1. It is quite lucrative.
2. There's a whole lot of work.

I have a bachelor in biology but let's be honest here, 15$ an hour ain't gonna cut it for me. This whole operation is to eventually acquire a property, whether it being a renting property or my primary residence. The issue that I currently have is that I'm maxed out in revenue for the company I currently work, I make 25$/h, but we only operate from mid April to mid November.

By acquiring the franchise, my hope is that I increase my overall earnings in the working season so that I could more easily qualify for a mortgage. I've made some scenario with the data provided by the franchisor, and all point out to it being a viable plan.

* Expenses are quite low due to the nature of the work we're making (mostly hedges trimming) which equates to around 10-12k for the season.
* Average price for service is 350$ with an average customer volume of 250 (even with a pessimistic 65% renewal scenario) this operation could potentially generate 70kgross per summer (based on my excel estimates).
* Franchise cost is 10 k over 2 years, with 5% royalty on subsequent customers.
* If my estimates are correct, this operation could net me on average 47 k (assuming company expenses, royalty fees, 10% time loss for transport, taxes and a 15 day no-work buffer).

Anyway, I'm curious to hear your opinion about my plan, and if any of you had prior experience in acquiring a franchise.

When to move USD -> CAD,"Personal finance illiterate, doing my best to school myself. I have been reading this sub for info, it’s been a great learning experience. We live in Canada. 

My husband is an independent contractor, working for an American company and is paid in USD. We have been letting it sit and accumulate as we have been using our CAD savings to pay for expenses.

Assuming that they add this feature in 1-2 years do you know if the contribution room will consider the book value ( what you paid) or the market value( what the share prices are in 2 years) with your experience from another broker?

Getting a mortgage as a freelancer (starting a business),"I recently left my career as an academic and moved back to Canada for health reasons after living overseas for about 15 years. I went through my savings while I was unemployed and going through treatment (I didn’t have that much saved up anyways).

After about a year unemployed, I started doing some freelance work. I have made more than expected and will be setting up my own business doing the same thing. The thing is, I’d really like to save up to buy my own house. Right now, I’m looking at buying in my hometown in rural Alberta (not my ideal location, but I need to be close to my parents who have health issues), so the house prices are low. (Currently there are 3 houses for sale in town, ranging from ~$180K - $240K.) 

I need to register my business, but I get the impression that the only way I could qualify for a mortgage within 2 years is to incorporate, so I could draw a salary. The thing is, I’m sure I’d need to hire a lawyer and an accountant at the very least to do that, and I’m not sure if it even makes sense to do it (or if it’s even possible) if I’m the only one working there. (I do actually hope to eventually hire others on, so there is some sense in structuring it as a corporation from the get go.)

From what I understand, if I register as a sole proprietorship, it’s the same as just doing freelance work in terms of qualifying for a mortgage - I’d need a minimum of two years of income documentation to do it. I’d really like to be able to get a mortgage earlier than that, if possible. (Though I’m not ready yet - I want significantly more than the down payment saved up as emergency funds.)

It might seem silly to think of buying sooner than two years, but I moved in with my parents when I got sick. I’m in my early 40’s and now that my treatment is basically done, I’m feeling pretty antsy not having my own space. 

I plan on going to talk to the bank sometime soon, but I haven’t had a chance yet. I wonder if there are any options that I’m missing in terms of how I can qualify for a mortgage as a small business owner.

Anyone considering moving out of Canada?,"We are doing everything we can to save for a house. Everything. 
Moved home. 
One car - used. 
Don’t eat out. 
Don’t go out - yes, Covid. But also to save. 
Lowered all bills possible. 
On and on ..

We are saving but it’s going to come down to the bidding wars. We are looking 4 hours outside of Van - we’re not even going to try close to home. Leaving behind all family and friends. 

But what kind of life is this? Overpaying for a home, likely scraping by for years and years. The quality of life in Canada financially doesn’t seems all that great. 

We can move to the US - my husband is employed by a US company. Homes there are SO affordable. 

I’m worried that if we went, we would be priced our forever and never be able to come home even if we worked there to save and build equity. 

Anyone else thinking of moving away? Have moved away? If so, does coming home to the market in 10 years worry you?

Edit: Hi everyone, thank you for your comments and suggestions. 

I just wanted to say that other parts of Canada are not off the table. I realized I left out some info when I posted. I just wanted opinions about US since it’s a card we do have. 

I know it’s not JUST about home prices. Using our take-home to be able to invest/retirement is actually a big reason to consider a lower cost of living. Please assume I have run the numbers with healthcare etc in mind. 

I have a NAFTA traded occupation so I *should* be able to find work. But we could live in US without me working. 

I do love Canada, of course, but at this point moving is happening elsewhere (Canada or US). I’m not even sad or ‘butthurt’ because I can’t afford Van. I grew up there and it’s v different now..I prefer a smaller town anyways. While I know BC is higher cost than other Provence’s, what is happening to this country in terms of QE and asset inflation is real and is affecting everyone. 

Please be kind I am just looking for help with this decision.",366,1611650841.0,2021,2021-01-26,,smashloves,106,l5a0bh

Unable to Cut Costs - Monthly Expenses Seem Too High (Venting),"In the past few years, I've become so much more focused on my finances. Although I don't live a very extravagant life (in my opinion), my debt was getting uncomfortably high. I've really reigned it in. 

Where I sit now, I feel that my monthly expenses are still too high. No matter how many different ways I look at it, I don't see anywhere left to make cuts. I review a spreadsheet frequently, and I check my bank accounts and finances WAY too often. So, since I have nowhere left to make cuts; instead, I keep funneling my ""loose change"" into dividend stocks, trying to create a snowbal effect of growing investments. 

I know I'll be in better shape than I am now in about 3 years when my car and line of credit are both paid off (hopefully). But until then, I live in anxiety.",5,1611647730.0,2021,2021-01-26,,DoubleOscar7,0,l59am1
Newcomer to Canada with an offshore company in Dubai - Taxes?,"Hello everyone,

I hope someone can advise me or point me in the right direction. I would appreciate it very much!

I'm a non-resident at present (and outside of Canada) but expecting to become a Canadian permanent resident in the next 1-2 years. Currently I reside in the UAE and I've been here for the past 10 years. I operate a small e-commerce business here under an LLC (sole owner) license with a company bank account. I have a substantial amount of savings here owing to the tax-free income I have enjoyed for over a decade and due to some timely crypto trades. At present, I hold both a personal account with TD Ameritrade for stocks and a personal account with Binance for my crypto/bitcoin holdings.

So, I wanted to know if there are any benefits of continuing to maintain my LLC license/bank account in Dubai after I have emigrated to Canada. Specifically, after becoming a tax resident in Canada, if I continue to hold my online investments (including cryptos) under the company account in Dubai, would I need to pay tax on the (i) business income from this LLC (ii) any capital gains realized as part of investment activity under this LLC account?

I hope that you can help me make a decision on whether to continue my LLC here since I would rather close it if it's no help in reducing my tax liability over there. If you guys had the option of an offshore company with a linked bank account, do you think it would reduce your tax liability on your international income and investments?

At the end, I do want to bring all my assets there but wanted the option of doing so at the right time in order to maximize tax deductions.

Please Help me Understand my TFSA Contribution Room,"I turned 18 in 2013. So I have 55,500 total in accumulated contribution room. (Correct me if I’m wrong). 

When I check CRA my account. My total contribution room is on Jan 1st, 2021 is 55,451.08. I was expecting it to be 55,500. Does that mean I must have contributed the difference between those two numbers (48.92) at some point in the past?

Also, in the second half of last year I put 31,000 in, but that doesn’t seem to have updated. Is it normal for the CRA page to not include last summer’s data?

Lastly, I’ve used some TFSA contribution room calculators online without understanding them. Are withdrawal amounts from previous years irrelevant in manually determining your total contribution room remaining? I.e., your available contribution room on Jan 1st, 2021 is all of your TFSA deposits together from previous years minus the total contribution room you’ve accumulated beginning in the year you turned 18? Is that correct?

My Financial Story and where I am now,"Hey everyone, I'm new to the Personal Finance Canada Community and I just wanted to share my financial story as I've gone through some significant changes in the last 10 months.

I graduated from the University this last April and I was super excited to move to Paris for a job I'd landed with a close friend before my senior year started. I was ready to help rebuild Notre Dame assisting one of the lead engineers I met at a summer birthday party. As my senior year was coming to a close Covid started to escalate and my school shut down in-person classes. Shortly after my soon-to-be boss notified me the efforts to rebuild the cathedral was going to shut down and my job was gone. 

I had another part-time consulting job I was beginning and that also got shut down. I was devastated and felt so lost. Over the next two months, I was determined to get a sales position at a tech company in my city but nothing came of it. I connected with so many people, zoomed with practically anyone who would take my calls, and applied for every position I could find but again, nothing came of it. I didn't get anymore with anyone. No callbacks from recruiters, no interview emails, nothing. 

After my 8 week sprint, I decided to stop submitting applications and pump the brakes on networking as it wasn't getting me the results I wanted. The summer was tough. It was difficult to see friends and classmates launch their careers. 

Over the summer, I thought about my money habits and my financial views as I had very little coming in (I was fortunate to move back in with my family and get some of that government covid money). I have never really been intentional with my money and grew up in a house that taught me the importance of frugality. In my mind, when I had to spend money it meant it was a luxury. I had to problem sacrificing my standard of living to maintain my familial philosophy of frugality. The problem was I didn't like this lifestyle and it wasn't healthy.

I started reading some basic financial books (rich dad, total money makeover, think and grow rich) hoping to change my habits/ beliefs and was very convicted by much I was reading. I made tracking my expenses a priority and obsessed over creating spreadsheets for budgeting, expense tracking, student loan debt and more. As I was becoming more educated, I noticed my money management was becoming more intentional and previous anxiety I used to have started to fade away. I became committed to paying off my student loans as quickly as I could. 

All of a sudden I landed a temporary full-time position with my local city's emergency management department. I wasn't a huge fan of the job but it put some cash in the bank. I was reading every single day and learning everything I could on how to be a better manager of my money. My family started to notice a change in me and I started teaching them some of the financial lessons I was learning. My parents have been self-employed their whole adult lives and have never been on a budget. I got them to consider creating one along with my younger brother, who has similar anxiety to myself when it comes to money. A family friend soon asked for my budget and I was happy to share with her the importance of tracking spending. 

This leads to now. My job with the city has ended and as a relatively new grad (getting close to one year out of school) I find myself in a similar position to where I was post-graduation, seeking employment. I've grown to enjoy personal finance I know I want to work towards building something that matters to me--I just don't know what that is now.

My question to the Personal Finance Canada community is what to do next? I have a passion to become financially independent from employment but at the same time, I recognize the importance of at least some monthly income! Let me know some of your thoughts...I'd love to hear what you people think!

The numbers in bright green are taken straight from my annual statements and WS website. I made no additional contributions in that time period. Both amounts are net of fees and taxes.

I simply used the p1-p0/p0 formula. And tried to estimate the percentage return for my advisor. 

Does this seem right? Did I miss any crucial details? For 2020 where I made withdrawals I tried to estimate the value of the cash flows by subtracting my estimated 2020 return with my actual one.

Losing land transfer credit,"Hi everyone, 

I’m considering buying a house and my sister has kindly offered to help me with the majority of the downpayment and in return she wants us to be 50-50 owners. I will be living there, paying the 100% of the mortgage and all other bills associated with the place. Her only contribution will be the downpayment which I’m very grateful for because it would take me years to save up this amount. 

My sister already has a house and has used the first time home buyers land transfer credit on it. Because she will be a part owner, will I have to forego my land transfer credit?


Edit: in Ontario 

Edit 2: I should of clarified, We’re doing a 20% downpayment so I can afford the payments on my own (works out to be almost the same as rent). Also, she’s giving of 90% of the downpayment because I recently used my savings to pay off my student loans.

I drive for work so whatever I buy is going to have to stick around for a while and is going to be driven until the wheels fall off.

Critical illness insurance,"I'm curious what everyone's  opinion on CII (Critical Illness Insurance) is.   

In my post college years I was convinced by a ""financial advisor"" to sign up to a 10 year term 11 years ago.  It has since renewed once and my premiums went up.  Because my plan includes a return of premium clause I'm trying to decide if it is worth switching to a permanent plan and eventually get them back when I turn 75  ( or should I pre- decease that my beneficiary will receive it) or if I should cut my loses (about 14K sunk so far) and start putting my payments in another investment.

In the short term if I get injured significant payout (not that I want the injury or disease - I would rather keep my limbs than get paid the money) and at my current payments it would take easily more than 20 years before my nest egg approaches the benefit (using 3% compounding growth)

That said through work I have disability insurance and I belive I gat some benefits through my wife's work as well.

If I stay on the current renewing 10 year term plan my last few years will include payments that seem ridiculously high, and in the end my premiums (and premium return) will add up to more than the benefit.

And the gist of the book is basically talking about how large firms on average pay better salaries, better benefits, less likely to cheat taxes or act immorally, that there's more oversight from various regulators,   compared to their smaller counterparts (basically a bunch of stuff about how they're better by nearly every metric for society).

They've concluded that large firms have far better employee diversity, productivity, innovation etc. And for example the common claim of ""But small businesses create many jobs!"" 
is mostly crossed out when you recall that most small businesses fail, reducing by just as many jobs as they created (this claim merely notes gross jobs, rather than the net)

They also note innovation is most significant in large firms, with the exception of tech startups... which are often, eventually bought out by the bigger fish anyways.

So why do we need to give so many lifelines to these small businesses that in all likelihood would have died out on their own, COVID or no COVID shutdown.",28,1611626832.0,2021,2021-01-25,Employment,NovelAdministrative6,2,l53ned

Car Insurance - Do or Do Not Claim a rear end?,"So someone rear ended me today at an intersection (AB, Calgary). I was waiting at a light to turn left. Light changed, I proceeded into the intersection then stopped as a pedestrian began to cross. The car behind me did not stop...

I am fine. It seemed like a hard hit, but could only have been a couple of car lengths at most from a stand still. The rear bumper is definitely dislodged from its normal position, the gap where it wraps around to the side is noticeably off spec.

I have a $750 deductible. I am going to get a quote on the damage in the morning. It is about 6 hrs later, I feel fine, I do not think there is whiplash or anything. Just damage to the car (2013 Civic, ultra low mileage). No airbags on either car deployed. Exchanged all registration, insurance, license and phone info. Police not called since it seemed minor with no injuries.

The other person wants to deal with it ""without insurance"". I am reluctant. But if the damage was say $1000, and I have a $750 deductible.. then maybe?

The other car was a small hatchback. Given it was one lane's distance, 1.5 lanes or so ... they could not have gotten up to much speed.

What would you advise? There were no witnesses (the pedestrian didn't stop and I didn't think to try and stop them). No dash cams that I am aware of.

If the damage (I will go for an estimate first thing in the AM) is less than or only a bit more than my deductible...?? I presume I have to pay the deductible even if the other party is found to be at fault?

Any advice appreciated.",11,1611624326.0,2021,2021-01-25,Insurance,kneedorthotics,1,l52uvi
PC Financial Mastercard Application,"Hi guys,

Put more money down or invest sale proceeds,"I am in the process of building a new house, should be ready to move in around May. I just sold my current house for $580,000, almost $90k over asking. My current mortgage is $230,000 and my LOC is maxed at $50k (maxed it out doing home renos for the sale).

Once I pay realtors, lawyer, incidentals and LOC off, I should have about $500,000 left over, minus mortgage (and discharge fees), I should have about $260,000 cash. I have already put $45k down on the new house that is being built under contract, I don't owe anything further. Value of the new house is just under $450,000.

I originally was planning on putting 10% down with a CMHC insured mortgage, which brings the total loan value to about $407,000.

Other tidbits:

* I intend to own this new house for 8-10 years, no more (its too big once I don't have kids at home).
* I would assume insured mortgage rate is like 1.7%, uninsured is 2.5%, investment savings would return 8% on average (being liberal here).
* If I reduce my mortgage payment, I could put the extra monthly money into savings, but there might be a psychological temptation to increase lifestyle with the extra cashflow.

Scenarios:

1) Would I be better to put the extra 260,000 onto the mortgage, which would make it no longer insured, but save money on the payments nonetheless?

2) Would I be better to put about 20% down to keep the mortgage insured, then the rest in savings.

3) Would I be better to put all 260,000 into savings.

Condo insurance question - FTHB,"Lots of questions so making this point form

* Location: Downtown Toronto

What part of a condo insurance coverage protects me against:

1. Water damage to anther condo unit
2. Potentially paying building's deductible ($50,000 that I assume is per unit)

&#x200B;

* Are both of these under the ""personal liability limit"" of $1,000,000? Or is it ""water related damage ($50k)"" in a TD quote and ""Sewer Backup - Policy Limit"" in a RBC quote?

&#x200B;

* What happens if my condo develops a leak and a condo below is affected, do they sue my insurance + claim any shortcomings from their insurance? And then if their insurance company feels like it, they would sue me personally?

&#x200B;

* What happens if building has a fire, which part of my condo insurance covers any building deductibles?

&#x200B;

\--

I am choosing:

1. $2000 deductible
2. $40,000 belongings coverage - I don't own anything fancy, furniture would be the most expensive possessions I have

I am a Canadian and I was working and living in the US with a TN Visa.  I own my Subaru Crosstrek outright.  

I lost my job and decided to head back home to Canada to settle down for a hot minute, but the Canadian border agency made me ""import"" my car on the spot, paying 5% duty and taxes + 6% (Japanese made, apparently) + change equalling ~$1250... Then $350+ online to have an inspection appointment. I assume the next step is to register and insure the vehicle.

The problem is I fully intend to get a new job in the US very soon. My home and fiancee and belongings are all in PA.

So, will I have to ""import"" the same vehicle back into the US? Have I not already, at some point in the purchase, paid the import or duty to the US?

Are all your savings in the stock market to try and get a bigger down payment?

Some background on me: I have lived in the Calgary area most of my life. Some time in Ottawa for school. 

*  I got an engineering job in 2013, got laid off early in 2015 due to falling oil prices (made about 70k). 
*  Got another job after EI and Welfare ran out early 2016, it was just min wage seasonal department work (work ended in Sept), 
* I took up pizza delivery during mid to late 2016 for a 1.5 years. 
* Got another engineering job (near min wage pay) for a half a year in 2017, due to the declining oil sector they didn't get a contract they laid off most of their staff, me too. It was around this time I buckled down and got my CC debts dealt with (yay!).
* Tried a few jobs, made near min wage. Laid off from one, quit another. Trades and other ""engineering"" work (it was manual labor).
* Come mid 2018 I got another engineering job (around 50k). It was a new department so I was basically running around with my head chopped off for a lot of it, but it was only half O&G and half other industries. Eventually oil went down again and laid off in mid 2019. At this job is where I started really padding my savings. A few bonuses and some tax returns. I am up to about 10k right now, mostly just in a TFSA doing nothing, and about 1.5k in ATB investor account (it follows the market and is managed by them.) It was a long commute so I spent a lot on gas every month (~$250-300)
* Come 2020 I got into a tech boot camp and EI, CERB, CRB, and student loan freezes helped me a lot to stay afloat
* I am self-employed on contract for about 75k a year right now until June. Possibility of extension but ya never know, right? But also no EI, which has been my lifeline isn't something I can get after this. 

I have lived at home since 2016 because I get a damn good deal on rent from my mother. Which will go up now that I am making more, which is fair. 

So I am here now. With a very interesting and rocky background of downs and a few dry spots. I HAVE tried applying to work in other areas of the country, and it wasn't until my tech bootcamp course was done AND everyone was working from home due to covid that I actually got an interview in another part of the country (over the course of the last 5 years I am talking hundreds of resumes sent to the Van, Tor, Mont areas and more). I do have a current job in YYC, because the other jobs were looking for something different.  

And my last car payment is next month (yay!), so I have some extra cash there every month now.
About 37k left in student loans. They have been paused almost every time I have been on EI because I can't afford the $405 a month. 

I watch my budget like a hawk watching a baby bunny. I have some bad spending habits I need to curb here and there, but they are the first to go when I get laid off. My other expenses are hard to limit (food, bills, insurance, etc). But with a new job I can afford to save a lot, and I am planning. But that's not the issue. 

So to reiterate, how do folks like me feel about ever being able to continually afford a house/mortgage? Ideally I would start with a small condo somewhere, but even on EI I doubt I could afford mortgage + condo fee + utils for very long. Not to mention most savings would be put on a down payment, so you never know when those will get topped up again. 

I have made long term budgets at min wage and it's just not in the cards to save and pay rent at 15/hr here (assuming roommates because forget about doing it alone). I have faith in getting future tech jobs, but with what size gaps between work? 

Speculation in the stock market is one thing, but speculation on affording a home is a scary conept.

Can Someone Explain Me How to Charge a Customer as a Freelancer?,"Hello everyone,

I am a newly graduated graphic and web designer. Due to COVID it is really hard to find a beginner level remote job in Montreal for now. But fortunately, I found someone who is looking for a freelancer graphic designer for their small project. We agreed on price and everything. I am going to make around $100 for this project.

Is a simple invoice enough for both of us? Something with ""invoice from"", ""invoice to"", ""description of service"", ""amount"" and ""bank information""? Is there anything else that I need to add? And most importantly, can both of us use this invoice for our taxing things? I do not want to cause any problem to the company because of my lack of financial knowledge.

How do I find a financial advisor in BC that helps me make good decisions?,"I don't want someone that makes money by selling me financial products. Rather, I'd like someone that I pay for the advice and has not got a financial incentive in me making a specific decision.

Need advice on: saving, possibly investments, housing and more

Severance Payout Advice,"Hello,

I was laid off last week and offered $15K lump sum severance, I have an appointment on Wednesday to have the offer looked over by a lawyer.  I have lived in Canada 6 years and for the first 4 years I made <$35K annually - made no RRSP contributions at that time.  I have unused contribution room in my RRSP from those years and think I should ask that some of the 15K be deposited directly into my 2020 RRSP so that I can use that as a downpayment loan in the next 5 years and then save that increased tax return as cash savings.  I have not made a contribution to my RRSP after the 1st Jan before, so I'm not 100% sure how it works or if I can request this?

I made $104K in 2020 (Income of 91K, vehicle allowance of $8K and bonus of $5K).  Contributed to my RRSP $6K (including employer contributions) and paid 21K income tax. Used increased income in 2020 paying off debts (CC and LOC) and currently have approx. $10K in the bank cash as emergency savings. Expenses are $3500 a month shared between me and spouse who is still working. Looking at the job market, my next job will most likely pay $50-70K but claiming EI while I look because how quickly I get that job is unknown.

Debt:

18K still owing on a 2020 car @ 1.99% interest.  Live in northern Alberta with no public transit in our town, so having a reliable vehicle in winter is important.

40K CAD owing on student loans abroad @ 1.1%.  Loan repayments are tied to income, so now I am claiming EI, my repayment will be minimal for the next 12 months. The 5K I had set aside for this 2021 repayment has now been put into my TFSA.

Could someone let me know if I am missing something important here, or if there is a reason I should \*not\* have the severance deposited directly into RRSP? Thanks for any help, as a new Canadian, I am still learning about this.",2,1611609588.0,2021,2021-01-25,,tr0028,0,l4xutd

How to raise credit score as a SAHM,"I don't work, it's been 6 years almost since I've made any money, so I'm not entirely sure what I can do to build my credit.

Taxable investment account: Ditching E-series for single ETF.,"Title.  I started investing with TD e-series a long time ago and the MERs for in the e-series portfolio are a little high for my account size now.  I want to sell everything and put it into a cheaper single ETF portfolio that matches my risk level (like XBAL, for example).

If I have $20k in unrealized capital gains, I should expect to pay taxes on this amount at my marginal tax rate next year if I sell today.

Getting first-ever Auto Loan,"I (22M) have bought every vehicle I've ever owned in cash. About 6 months ago however, I got a big raise and started working full-time at my company, and as a result am making a lot more money than I ever have before. I have a couple grand put away now, and as I will probably need a new vehicle come spring my dad recommended I look at getting a loan. He said he'd be willing to cosign and pointed out that not only could I afford a better vehicle that way, but it would help me build my credit.

I have a credit score around 660, with a pretty short history that only includes my small student loan (about $9k), my phone plan, and a CapitalOne card I got a couple months ago. Almost never been late on anything.

I ended up talking to a rep from an auto group here in Vancouver (I already confirmed they are a real established auto group and not a scam) and after a week or so she texted me to say that her finance manager had gotten me approved for a loan from Scotiabank in my own name, no cosign required. It would be for a truck that I'm not all that excited about, but apparently I can change the vehicle before I finalize everything. She said it was a 1-in-a-million shot, and that being on a loan by myself would be outstanding for my credit. Thing is, I'm not sure about this, and I'm not even sure I want to get a loan for a vehicle yet. 

Is she right in that getting approved by myself with my credit history is as fantastic as it is, and that it will be that much better for building credit, or is she just trying to sell me on something I don't need? On top of that, I'm a dual citizen (US/Canada) and am thinking of possibly moving back to the states in a year or two.

Escort wanting credit card increase,"First of all I would like to ask for no rude comments or judgement. 

&#x200B;

I've been working as an escort for 2 years, with on and off regular jobs in between. I am fully supported by income from escorting. I am wanting to increase my credit limit on my credit card, right now I only have a $1000 limit from when I first got my credit card when I was 19. I've made it work but its just not really sustainable as an adult and am wanting to increase it to $2000 or $3000. About one year ago the bank teller told me I was pre approved for an increase of $7,500 but for some reason I didn't go for it. This was when I was employed with a regular employer. The problem I am facing now, is I am no longer with that employer but it is still the information the bank has on file for me. I am not sure if I go into the bank and ask for a credit increase they will automatically do it because I am pre approved, or if they will question and want to update my employer information before doing so. I don't exactly want to put ""escort"" as my occupation and my working name as my employer on my banking information. I've tried doing it online to see if I can skip out on giving this info but the form asks for even MORE information, address of work place, how long you've worked there, phone number, etc.

Does anyone have any insight? What are my options? Could I get away with saying I still work for the company even when I don't? 

Thanks so much in advance.",4,1611604121.0,2021,2021-01-25,,Carmen523,1,l4vu12
Someone I know has lied in bankruptcy court - anything I can do?,"I just ended a business relationship with a property manager who takes pride in scamming people it appears. I found out that they had been letting friends rent our places for below market value and even moving in months ahead of any rent coming our way, not collecting damage deposits without our knowledge, etc. We found out a lot of this info when listing our properties for sale, and what I was telling our realtor wasn't jiving with what they were finding during their viewing of the properties. Vacant units weren't vacant, etc.

This crappy ex-property manager is now giving our tenants 'advice' and pretty much fanning bad behaviour by tenants during inspections/showings/etc. One of the most shocking things I heard personally from this individual was bragging about keeping a significant amount of cash in a safe deposit box, and lying about the contents during a recent bankruptcy hearing. Is there a way to report this to someone anonymously? I'm not usually a vindictive person, but the shite coming from this individual isn't stopping and they need to be taken down a peg.

I'm 33 and don't understand the first thing about PF," 

TLDR; Looking for some guidance on finally taking some responsibility for my own PF. I'm not facing any imminent crises as far as I know; I just want to be able to assess my own situation and figure out the best path forward in the coming months/years. Making any decisions about money, including just making large purchases, gives me total anxiety. How bad/good/okay is my current situation? What should my goals for 2021 be? Most importantly, where can I go to learn the absolute basics about stuff like TFSA/RRSP/investing?

Apologies for what will be a long and rambling post from someone entirely clueless about PF.

&#x200B;

**About me​**​

I'm 33 and know nothing about money and finance. Whenever I see news articles or reddit threads about the economy, it sounds like another language to me. Whenever I hear friends or family talking about their investments, my eyes glaze over and I try to think about something else until the topic changes. Even thinking about money gives me anxiety. My dad still does my taxes and I don't even know what ""doing taxes"" means. With all that said, I'm otherwise not dumb and fully independent.

I recently ended a long and highly abusive/dangerous relationship with alcohol (\~14 mos sober now). And now that it's starting to sink in that sobriety might be the new norm for me, I'm starting to accept that I actually might have a ""longterm"" that I need to plan for, provided I can get in shape and curb my unhealthy relationship with food (so far so good in 2021).

I'm single and don't really have any plans to change that. But who knows?

&#x200B;

**My job​**​ 

I have the same job I got right out of university through the co-op program. I work for a large well-known high-tech company in a major Canadian city. It's steady, safe, and easy for me. I make \~$67k plus 5% RRSP matching and a pretty reliable \~$4k annual bonus. So I guess you could say I make about \~$74k.Uh, I also have these company ""stocks"" that only turns into real stocks if I stay with the company for another \~3 years I think. I really don't understand how they work, but the estimated current value is only like $8k. 

As you can expect from someone who's never moved jobs, I am underpaid. Some quick research shows I could probably make a base salary in the $80-85k range if I moved companies. I'm not actively looking, but I did recently interview for a position at another company, only because the opportunity was passed on to me. I was fully qualified and a good candidate, but they went with someone else. It's pretty clear that I have 0 experience with actually interviewing for real jobs and selling myself. But I'm grateful for the experience of that failed venture.

I know that I really **should**​ find that higher-paying job. But to be honest I'm not really in the market to increase my stress levels at this time.  I'm not happy in my current job but I'm not unhappy either. It's flexible and easy. I can work from home whenever I want (pre-pandemic too) and could even transition to fully remote if I wanted to. 

&#x200B;

**My finances​**​

So I have \~$35k in my TFSA. I automatically deposit $100 to it monthly and send them a lump sum cheque whenever I have extra cash. Though I haven't done that in **years**​. I have no idea what a TFSA is or how it works or what that money is for. I don't know ""how"" it's invested or even what that means. I know there's a contribution limit and that I am well below it.

I have an RRSP or an RSP (don't know what the difference is) with like \~$120k. I deposit 10% of my paycheque automatically and my company matches half that. No idea how that's invested, but at least I know what that money is for. No idea what happens with this if I move companies.

I have \~$64k in an ""investment fund"" that I inherited from my grandparents almost 20 years ago. It was originally intended for school, but I ended up not needing it. So I guess now I can use it however I want. I have no idea what kind of ""fund"" this is, I just know it's with the same bank that handles my regular chequing account.

I have \~$15k sitting in my chequing account. Leftover money from a year of not buying booze or travelling, I guess. Also have \~$2k USD which I only use when I go to the States, but I haven't had to travel there in almost 3 years now. 

All of these things (having a TFSA, contributing to RRSP) I am doing because my parents told me to. 

&#x200B;

**My assets**

I don't own a home; I rent an apartment.

I own a 2005 chevvy which I drove fairly sparingly pre-pandemic, and which is now just sitting in the parking garage eating insurance money. I do still want to own a car post-pandemic (public transit sucks here and I do like taking road trips). But I do think I need a new one (I was actually shopping for one before the lockdown started in March 2020). Cars are the one thing I possibly understand even less than PF, and the thought of shopping for a new one gives me anxiety. But this is the main reason I still have all that money floating around in my chequing account. Of course, there is no reason for me to buy until the pandemic is over.

Other than that, I own a rather valuable MtG collection which I really really should sell. I haven't played the game in like 7 years and likely won't again. The cards are probably worth \~$12k and are just sitting around.

&#x200B;

**My place​**​

I rent a 2-bdrm apartment for about $1200/mo + $70/mo parking. I've only been here for about 3 years, but rent in my building has already shot up by like $300 for the vacant units in my building. Fortunately rent in my province can only go up by a small amount each year, so I'm safe where I am. I'm actually interested in moving to a nicer place with a dishwasher/AC/in-unit laundry and am willing to spend a little more on rent, but rent has increased everywhere in my city so moving is basically not an option for me.

I guess I wouldn't mind owning a home someday. No idea if I would want a house or a condo, or if I want it to be in the city, or a smaller town/city an hour away.

&#x200B;

**Other expenses​**​

Nothing out of the ordinary. I'm mostly pretty reluctant to buy big items as I get nervous with big commitments on stuff like furniture or electronics. (The last time I needed a new PC, I waffled on it for over a year before my old PC actually exploded and I had to make a rush purchase.) Currently, I pretty desperately need to buy a new couch and probably a laptop. I've needed these things for years, but I just detest shopping so much.

My major vice in 2020 was Uber Eats, but I'm getting that under control in 2021. Let's hope these new habits stick.

I am tracking every dollar I spend in a spreadsheet. I've actually had this habit for years. So I know just how many thousands of dollars I spend on Uber Eats last year and on alcohol in the years before that. I'm looking forward to using my money on better things in 2021.

&#x200B;

Age-old retirement questions: How old and how much?,"A bit of a broad question, but I am curious as to what others think their ideal age of retirement would be and how much you plan to have in the bank when you retire?

Pension Transfer to WS or Questrade via cheque?,"Has anyone done this not using a banking transfer? How does one get the pension from their former employer to a WS or Questrade LIRA? My former employer, a university, wants to mail a cheque, as opposed to doing a transfer. They manage the pension themselves, not through a bank or third-party. Both WS and Questrade seem to only have options to add funds from other banks? I've used the WS contact forms to get an answer on this, but it's been a week and no reply so far, which makes me a bit nervous about using them for this particular type of thing. Do I need to open an account with a traditional bank to make sure that this doesn't get screwed up somehow?  If I did do that, I'm guessing that I couldn't transfer from say a LIRA with BMO to a WS LIRA due to the restrictions around LIRAs? Thank you!",2,1611598445.0,2021,2021-01-25,,aarongoulding,1,l4tp8z
Mom Gifted Car Before Passing - but not legally?,"Hello, 

My mother passed last week from an illness and things have been difficult to maneuver. I have a question on what status her vehicle is in based on what I understand. We live in Ontario. 

She had purchased the car from a dealership as brand new last year, and it was on 'loan' or 'lease' from them - not sure on the right term. So essentially she owned it but she paid down the amount owing. Prior to passing she took out a loan and paid the car in full, so she now legally owns it. Prior to passing, I wrote out a ""contract"" saying that she is selling/gifting me the car, which she signed with me and a witness, and I also filmed it. Does this count for anything? 

I'm concerned about her estate having debt, and the banks coming for the car if it is technically in her estate. Is the car technically not in her estate since it now belongs to be since her passing? We didn't have time to go to Service Ontario to do any paperwork to transfer it. 

Any advice is appreciated! 

Thanks!",18,1611597351.0,2021,2021-01-25,,TeamAlexPapa,5,l4ta1e

Soon-to-be grad losing parents insurance coverage. Any recommendations for affordable drug/dental insurance plans in Ontario?,"I (almost 22F) am in my final year of my undergrad and will be graduating this spring.

I’d consider myself a very healthy person with low healthcare usage, but I do have a drug prescription where I’m unsure of how expensive it will be without insurance. I also try to get my teeth cleaned twice a year, as recommended.

Does anyone have any recommendations for a low-cost dental/drug plan for new grads in Ontario? I don’t need anything fancy.

>Four times as many jobs were lost last year due to the coronavirus pandemic as during the worst part of the global financial crisis in 2009, a U.N. report said Monday.

>The International Labor Organization estimated that the restrictions on businesses and public life destroyed 8.8% of all work hours around the world last year. That is equivalent to 255 million full-time jobs - quadruple the impact of the financial crisis over a decade ago.

>“This has been the most severe crisis for the world of work since The Great Depression of the 1930s. Its impact is far greater than that of the global financial crisis of 2009,” said ILO Director-General Guy Ryder. The fallout was almost equally split between reduced work hours and “unprecedented” job losses, he said.

>The United Nations agency noted that most people who lost work stopped looking for a job altogether, likely because of restrictions on businesses that hire in big numbers like restaurants, bars, stores, hotels and other services that depend on face-to-face interactions.

>The drop in work translates to a loss of $3.7 trillion in income globally — what Ryder called an “extraordinary figure” — with women and young people taking the biggest hits.",52,1611592692.0,2021,2021-01-25,Employment,MarineKingPrime_,80,l4rjxi

Paying off an old debt,"Update: 3.5 hours on that horrid wait loop and that 1-888 number finally worked and it was indeed the estates department and he gave me exactly what I needed in a matter of seconds. I hate bureaucracy. 


So yes, normally people would be like NO DON'T PAY IT!

But I have a credit card with capital one that is in good standing and always paid off, but I apparently had one that was not in good standing and charged off. For some reason they never sent it to a collections company, so it's been sitting in ""Capital One Recovery"". 

I have been trying to get a hold of someone to get the routing number to pay it off in full, and I kept getting told I had to wait for a callback. Well I've waited and waited for the callback, didn't get it. So I called again and ended up getting the direct line to ""Capital One Estates and Recovery"" which I don't think the kind call center man was supposed to give me. Because I tried the whole press 2 to talk to a French person thing and she genuinely tried to help me and she even got told I was going to have to get a call back and tried to backtrack on the existence of this 1-888 number (which is why I think the guy made a mistake in giving me it) 

I tried calling the 1-888 line on friday and I was on a ""please hold"" loop for 2 hours. I haven't found this number ANYWHERE on the internet so I don't know if I'm even in a queue or it's just telling me I'm in a queue and going to keep me on this horrid loop over and over.

Should I put my savings into a TSFA account?,"Hello, so I currently have about 100k inside of an EQ high interest savings account. I am wondering if I should move most of it to a TSFA account (I think I can move about 45k, the last time I checked). The thing is, right now I am a PhD student living with my parents. I plan to move with my girlfriend to a different city in about 1.5 years. Then we will probably rent a place for a couple of years and buy a house after. The reason I am asking is that I heard that if you withdraw money from a TSFA account, you can't just put it back when you have spare money. I also haven't really looked into stock options either, prefer to have my finances completely hands off for now. Would it be safe for me to put the money in the TSFA account now and then hope I will be able to save enough extra money in the next couple years with my girlfriend to buy a house?

I'm interested in investing my money rather than paying lump sums towards my OSAP since I want to learn more about investments.

Thinking about buying a used car - looking for advice,"I'm not sure if this is the appropriate sub to ask this question, so if there is a better one, please let me know and I'll ask there.

TL;DR:  Need advice on buying a used beater car.  Never bought anything not already safetied and don't want to get a lemon.

I haven't owned a car for a few years now.  After my last vehicle died, I decided it wasn't worth it to buy another one since I'm very close to all amenities and wasn't really using my vehicle much at the time.

What I have been doing, is renting a car when I really needed one to get around and run errands.  This was actually less expensive for me - I was able to drive a new car without the added expenses of maintenance and monthly insurance.    I was renting a car maybe once a month - either for the day, or over the weekend and it was all still much less expensive than having a car on the road.

My personal circumstances have changed, and I am finding that I am needing the convenience of a car more often these days, so renting isn't as financially sound as it was before.   I am thinking about a beater car - something super cheap just to get me from point A to point B.  I wouldn't need it for great distances - 30 minute drives round trip max - so I really don't want to look at buying something new and financing it.

I am a little hesitant about buying a used vehicle that isn't already safetied.  Obviously, a beater car that's cheap isn't going to be safetied (at least nothing in my city seems to be).   So I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions on good, reliable cars I might pick up for cheap (Make, model).   My last vehicle was a little hatchback and I loved it - good on gas and still had loads of room for storage so ideally this would be my preference.  Also, if anyone has any advice on what is required for a safety.  I did look online and have a list, but hearing from other people who know a lot more about cars would be helpful.  I used to know a lot of ""car guys"", but I'm in a new city and don't know anyone local I can ask.  This is the first time I'll be buying a car myself without help and it's feeling a little overwhelming.   Is it worth the money to take the vehicle to a mechanic for an inspection before making an offer to buy?

Any advice from people more familiar with vehicles would be greatly appreciated.

\- I was trying to figure out how it would compare to holding long term on VOO, or VGRO -- is REIT more risky (I don't see how real estate can suddenly drop a 30%), or they are just apples and oranges that can't compare?

Does anyone have experience with this fund, any thoughts?

In-Kind Transfer confusion,"Ok. I’m spinning in circles trying to understand the exacts of an in-kind transfer and everywhere I look I just get more confused.

I’m really hoping SOMEONE can help me understand this.

So here’s my confusion. Articles have said my investments will transfer between brokers “as is”. They then go on to say however that the broker will receive my investments at the market value on the day of the transfer. 

To me this sounds contradictory, because if my investments were to move over “as is”, the average price would come along too, right?

Simply put. If I own 100 shares of ABCD at $50, will it transfer over at the price of $50? Or will it transfer over when ABCD is trading at $51 on the day of the transfer.

I’m not sure if I made that easy to understand, but I’m really hoping someone can help haha

Feeling confused about group RRSP with RBC,"Recently received company match for RRSP at a match of 100% and I got 'guided' into a mutual fund pick by the financial advisor (conservative portfolio).

I have no idea now if this was the right way, I now look back at the MER and think it's too up there in terms of fee at nearly 2%. Is it right that I continue to stick with this group RRSP plan? I already signed it and didn't have much guidance going into this. 

I might've preferred going with a brokerage like QT and picking my own ETFs/stocks myself, but this was the mutual fund the advisor presented me with. So I went with it. 

Should I ask to change it now - go for a growth portfolio? Stick with this (at least it's matched)? And keep it until I leave and then transfer it to another brokerage that I use later? 

For those who are familiar with group RRSPs or company match with RBC, what would you recommend or what is the best method to keep the money and continue growing it?

Consumer Proposal already filed HELP,"
I filed a CP and then received an offer to sign a release from a car accident I was a passenger in two years ago for $5000.

The company asked me if I had any open suits and I had forgotten about the accident since it’s been so long so I said no.

Spousal RRSP attribution rules,"I (47M) have been contributing to a spousal RRSP and getting matching from my employer for my own RRSP.  I make a lot more than my wife and the plan was to use the spousal RRSP for income splitting.  We started this before the pension splitting rule change.  My wife (46F) has about 50k more in her spousal RRSP than I have in mine.  She is planning on retiring soon and I thought it would be a good opportunity to make withdrawals from the spousal account to put into a TFSA (we have a lot of unused room there).  Because of the attribution rules, I'd have to stop contributing to the spousal account for three years before she can take out the RRSP money without being counted as my income.  I have a couple questions about this plan.
1) After stopping contributions and then making  withdrawals from the spousal RRSP, there will be a large imbalance between our accounts.  Will this impact our ability to income split in the future?  I understand that once we turn 65 and convert to RRIFs, we can still income split but what are the chances these rules will change.
2) If my wife withdrawals from the spousal account, then I won't be able to claim the spousal basic income deduction on my taxes.  Will that nullify the advantage of moving funds from the RRSP to TFSA (assuming we'd invest the tax savings)?

Assumptions: Our retirement plan is for me to stop working at around 62.  The goal is to have ~$150k income per year pre-tax which when split will give us $120k (approx. 20% tax).",3,1611548033.0,2021,2021-01-24,,mg_qwerty,6,l4for3

Why are people acting like ARKX (Ark space ETF) is a IPO? Am I missing something?,"I will admit, I am excited to see the new ARK Space ETF, ARKX, launch, and track its progress.

""Gotta get in quick before it takes off, there is so much hype around it""

""Hmm, should I wait till the hype wears off and people start selling, to get a better price"". 

From my understanding, when it launches, its not gonna take off BASED on how many people buy the ETF. If shares run out, they will simply add more shares to purchase, as the price will be solely based around the NAV price. Correct?

"Questions about pensions - DCPP, LIRA/LIF and RRSP rules","Hey all,

I have an option to cash out my defined benefit pension from an old job. Half of it can go to an RRSP or cash and the other half can go to either a LIRA or LIF. I am trying to determine a few things about how these accounts work, but can't find a good source for it. Banks provide very vague information while government sites seem to just be pages and pages of laws. Any help would be much appreciated.

From my understanding, putting the 50% in the RRSP is good since I can access it whenever I want (if I pay the tax) or use it for the home buyer program. 

I'm a bit confused about the LIRA vs LIF - from what I read a LIRA becomes an LIF when you unlock it. So if I can put the money into an LIF right away, does that mean I will start getting payouts immediately? It seems like that would be a better option simply for the flexibility. How does it work? Also, can I invest in individual stocks with a LIRA or is that considered day trading and not allowed like with a TFSA?

Regarding defined contribution pension plans: I just read that contributing to an RPP takes away from RRSP room. Does that mean that if I start paying into a defined contribution pension plan this year then using up all of my RRSP room with the commuted value of my old pension would result in using over my maximum contribution room? Or does the amount paid into my DCPP this year only affect my RRSP room for next year? 

The DCPP is with Sunlife, I was expecting to be able to invest the funds myself or keep them in cash, but they want me to select from a limited list of their own index funds. Is this required to get the DCPP? My employer matches so I want to take advantage but it would suck if I need to use their funds that have high management fees.

Tax responsibility on RRRIF distribution at death,"I have a general estate/RRIF tax question I'm hoping someone can help me understand. I am using fictional names for the purpose of illustrating the story. All the individuals involved are Ontario residents and Canadian citizens. They are also immigrants and aren't familiar with the nuances of the tax system. 

John, the annuitant of an RRIF with a remaining of ~$90,000 passed away in Dec of 2019. In his will, it is written that his adult daughter Jill is the beneficiary of this RRIF, but 25% of the funds are to be given to his former common-law spouse Jane.  Jill, an adult is financially dependent on her father as she made less than the basic personal amount in 2020.

In February of 2020, Jill cut Jane a cheque for ~$22,000 (the 25%). Jill is telling me she is liable for the taxes on the full ~$90,000, and Jane doesn't have to pay any taxes.

Would Jill be liable for the taxes on the full ~$90,000, or only the part that she was legally entitled to? Does Jane receive 20,000 tax-free?

Fund Availability after Selling.,"Hey Everyone, 

So far I've only really bought stocks and seen the funds transacted updated on the balance sheet immediatley after purchase.  It does seem to take a day or two for the actual stocks to show up on my positions  page though? I use Questrade.   I'm wondering how it works if I sell stocks.  Upon selling at market price, how soon after will the funds be available for purchasing more stocks?  Do I have to wait a day or two as well for the transaction to be fully realized?

Thanks,",3,1611535963.0,2021,2021-01-24,Investing,Dblazer,2,l4c2v7

Looking for Ideas for Better Budgeting,"Hi All

Hoping to gain some collective intelligence on how to budget myself better, so I can invest/save more.

For 2021, one of my new years resolution is to have a better financial grip. However, the month of January did not really go well as I planned, so I figured I will seek assistance from Reddit, and hopefully post my monthly progress.

On the positive note, I began my contributions for RRSP and CSPP (company stock purchase plan), and have opened up a savings account.

Below is my monthly income and expenses broken down at the moment. 

The numbers exclude any additional, fluctuating incomes or extra compensation that I receive from time to time. I will be dividing up the extra income and invest half and save the other half.

*earning before tax = bi-weekly pay.
* net monthly earning is what i get paid per month after the RRSP, CSPP, and tax.

&#x200B;

||Earnings|
|:-|:-|
|Before Tax|$2,541.61|
|RRSP|\-$355.83|
|CSPP (Company Stock)|\-$381.25|
|**Monthly Bring Home Pay**|**$2,629.44**|
|||
||**Monthly Expense**|
|Car (Leased)|\-$586.48|
|Parking|\-$90|
|Cat Spending - incl savings|\-$100|
|Phone|\-$58.14|
|Car Wash|\-$33.89|
|Netflix|\-$18.99|
|Car Insurance (Paid Annually)|\-$187.75|
|Amazon Prime (Paid Annually)|\-$6.58|
|**Net Monthly Expense**|**-$1,081.33**|
|||
|**Net Surplus**|**$1,548.11**|

&#x200B;

Expenses that would constitute as ""unnecessary"" would be my car wash, Netflix, and Amazon Prime, and these make up $60. 

However, my parents and my friend are also using my Netflix and Amazon Prime account, and in exchange, I get YouTube prime from my friend and I don't mind spending $20 bucks a month for my parents to enjoy TV. 

For the car wash, I am bit of a clean freak, so I use the car wash every time I go somewhere. I have a monthly pass which allows me to wash the car as many times as I want (once a day), and as long as I wash my car 4 times a month, I would break even. It's one of my pet peeves.

&#x200B;

Since I am lucky in a way that I don't have to pay rent (would be equivalent to $2000 in Toronto area), I was thinking of spending at least $1000 into investing or savings per month, in addition to the RRSP and CSPP. 

My thoughts on break down of this would be - 

$400 on investing

$400 on savings

$200 on crypto-currency.

&#x200B;

I guess my question is

1. Is my plan feasible?
2. Am I investing good amount? Should I invest more or less?
3. How can I improve my plan?
4. What are things that I am not looking at, but should be paying attention to?
5. How should I spend the rest of $500

Any inputs will be appreciated.

"Company allowing direct transfer to RRSP, what would you do?","My company is allowing me to put up to 75% of my performance bonus directly into the company group RRSP. Traditionally this has higher MER but in my situation it's irrelevant because in a couple days after the bonus is paid I will be leaving the company and given the choice to transfer the group RRSP into my own TD E Series SDRSP. 

I've read about the TFSA vs. RRSP discussion. And usually, I'm in favor of maxing my TFSA first, but I'm still a bit confused as to whether there's any benefits for electing my bonus to a RRSP if my company allows to directly pay the bonus in there at the pre-tax amount. 

So, the TLDR: if your company allows direct bonus payout to RRSP...would you take it vs. collecting the bonus in cash and putting it in a TFSA?

Condo owner insurance on a condo townhouse,"Hello, first time home buyer here with a recent purchase of a condo townhouse in Ontario.

I have personal property and premise liability insurance, but have a question about another insurance coverage, namely Square One's Condo Owner's Protection Coverage, which

protect against loss or damage to common property, fixtures or improvements within your unit.

Since this is an optional coverage, I am not sure if I have to include it in my policy, and whether the things covered by it are commonly insured things?

For example, are the floors, walls, countertops considered common properties?

If I do renovations and get new floors, new kitchen, etc. are these still considered common properties and covered?

Overall, is condo owner's protection necessary for condo townhouse owners?

Unemployed for over a year and I don't know what my next step should be anymore. (AB),"I am turning 35 this year and finished a masters degree in financial mathematics a year ago. I finished my undergrad and grad courses with straight A's and a single A-. I am an expert in option pricing, numerical analysis, pure and numerical linear algebra, stochastic processes and probability theory.

Aside from that, I feel like I have no skills. I never even started high school and worked in retail until I started college in my mid 20s.

Since graduating, I have had no real employment. I make approximately $500-$1000 a month taking on odd jobs like research assistant roles and tutoring first year mathematics.

I have zero debt, and I am essentially living rent free at the moment. In total, I spend about $500 a month on various bills and expenses. I was living with/taking care of my grandmother with my mother in her hoarder house, but she passed away on Christmas day and I am not quite sure what the future holds as the estate etc gets resolved. At this point, it is expected that I will receive nothing.

I have $14k in my savings account and a considerable amount of emergency funds in the form of unrealized gains (measured in the hundreds of thousands) I could draw down if I am forced to. I got this from successfully investing in the stock market prior to starting my undergrad and then promptly ignoring it until now. I am very hesitant to do anything with the money so that I have something when I am nearing retirement age.

Finally, I have essentially no family left that I know except my mother. My next of kin are essentially strangers and as such I would like my assets to go to my alma mater and long time girlfriend.

At this point, I don't know what to do with my life anymore. I have been struggling to find employment for more than a year. I have essentially exhausted all my contacts that put forth words of recommendations for me with their hiring managers, but hiring freezes has meant that they have gone nowhere.

Since a priority for me is to ensure my girlfriend gets the majority of my assets if something were to happen to me, I registered her as a beneficiary to my registered accounts and my bank highly recommended I hire a lawyer to properly handle the previously mentioned unrealized gains for me. The problem is that, with $14k and essentially no job, I just don't think it makes financial sense to spend such a significant amount of my savings on legal fees until I can get a stable position.

I feel like I spend every day in isolation playing computer games, solving leetcode problems, and tinkering with my resume in a very small personal space within a filthy hoarder house. I think I am spiraling into madness and I should possibly hire a psychiatrist for my mental well-being, but again, I don't think it is wise to spend what money I have on something like this without a stable source of income.

Every day I am trying to learn some new skill like SQL, Power BI, and just pushing up my leetcode completed question count to be able to better meet minimum qualifications for jobs and I can't tell if any of it even helps me. I feel like my expertise mathematics is worthless without more practical abilities and it is killing my prospects.


Edit: I did not expect this number of comments and I am struggling to respond to all of them. I want to thank everyone for the support and comments. Many of you have taken time to write lengthy and thoughtful responses.

COVID M/Paternity Benefits ($500/Week?!),"Howdy folks! Expecting a baby in August 2021 (yay!) with my wife and just trying to figure some of the maternity/paternity benefits out. So here's our situation:

* Me - Full-Time Employed, making $75K/year. Employer tops up 1 month of paternity. Also have a freelance contract worth approx. $500 / month (which I assume I have to stop while I'm on paternity).
* Wife - Self-Employed. Income fluctuates year to year, but in 2020 she made about $40K. Also has a part-time job working approximately 8 hours per week local retail (min. wage). 
* Live in British Columbia.

Now because my wife is mostly freelance, we originally were assuming that she wasn't going to get any maternity benefits. (The part-time job is just for fun, and wouldn't get her close to the 600 hours you need to qualify.) We looked into the self-employed maternity leave, but it didn't seem worth it to us as she'd have to keep paying the EI premiums on all her income in perpetuity (and she didn't even necessarily want to even take a full 12 months off). So we had sorta written it off, until...

Today, I saw something about COVID maternity benefits. Checked the Service Canada website, and sure enough there it is:

[https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-maternity-parental/apply.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-maternity-parental/apply.html)

*""As of September 27, 2020, there are some temporary changes to the EI program to help you access EI maternity and parental benefits. The following changes will be in effect for 1 year and could apply to you:*

* *You only need 120 insured hours to qualify for benefits because you'll get a one-time credit of 480 insured hours to help you meet the required 600 insured hours of work*
* *For maternity and standard parental benefits, you'll receive at least $500 per week before taxes but you could receive more.""*

So if I'm reading this correctly, suddenly her 8 hours a week at her part-time job should qualify her for **at least $500/week** while on maternity/paternity? (We estimate she'd have at least 300 hours over a year period, even with taking days off, which puts us well over the 120 hour mark.) This is a bit bonkers to me, as right now she only makes about $100 / week. But maybe this is a lucky case of being in the right time/right place to get these COVID benefits?

So taking this into consideration, here's our plan:

* Wife starts taking maternity/paternity in June 2021. Stops all freelance work and part-time work. Takes off until at least January 2022. (7 Months) She might take more if she can?
* Husband (me) takes paternity September-October-November. Employer tops off salary in September, and take the approximate half EI pay for October-November.

Questions for you:

* Is all the information I've listed accurate? Any holes or parts that I've misunderstood?
* Will my wife get the $500/week for her entire maternity/paternity leave?
* If I (husband) take 3 months of paternity, what is the max maternity+paternity time my wife can take? (Not the extended 18-month benefits, just standard shared benefits for 12 months. If I take 3 of those, does that mean she is left with 9? Or is there something I heard about us getting more because we're sharing the time?)

Thanks in advance! Love you guys and everything you do here.",14,1611527759.0,2021,2021-01-24,Budget,HugoChavez2,9,l49h0u

Purchasing a home - Which one would you prefer?,"We're a couple (age 35+) with a young kid, for the same budget I can have the following options:

1. 900 sqft condo in a city centre - convenient life but crime rate is higher and very busy/noisy location. Close to skytrain. We're currently renting within the proximity.
2. 900 sqft condo in a town centre in another city - close to outdoor activites and everything we love
3. 1800 sqft+ rather new townhouse or an old house in a remote location, around 30-40 min drive from our current community

From investment standpoint, price of condo 1 goes up a bit faster than condo 2, roughly total 5% more in the past 3-4 years. Public schools within catchment are about the same rankings according to [https://www.compareschoolrankings.org](https://www.compareschoolrankings.org), but condo 2 has better private schools (not sure if we can afford it) to choose from.

Condo 2 is 15-20 min drive from condo 1 so we can still sort of meet our friends often but expect to see fewer friends visiting us (of course after the pendemic).

Option 3 is the only way that can fullfill our dream of owning a ""house"" and our own front and back yard in North America, but the schools are way worse and of course we have to make new friends again.

By the way, we can live comfortably in either case so floor area is really not the deciding factor tho.

Advice on behalf of my girlfriend.,"Throwaway for obvious reasons lmao. 


My girlfriend was pretty dumb and put her name on an ex boyfriends WiFi bill with Rogers, with the understanding he would pay it since he wasn’t able to get WiFi. The reason he couldn’t get WiFi was because he let bills run up with bell and Rogers for over 1K a piece and refused to pay. 

I’m wondering what my girlfriend can do in this situation, her ex cheated on her and she left in a hurry, she has since tried to get the money from him and obviously he is refusing knowing full well her name is on the bill, but he is harassing her to pay it and cancel the WiFi so his new girlfriend can get WiFi set up in his place. 

I’m financially sound and very savvy with money, but she is not and is just trying to get herself out of old debts and learn how to make better decisions, in actual fact this subreddit is one of the main sources I use to teach her about money. 

The account is not closed right now, but she is thinking on closing it as soon as she figures out her course of action. Basically is there a way to negotiate the bill down with Rogers? She has some money now but not enough to pay it all, does anyone know how to go about doing that? If it’s at all possible?

Investors - do you feel that you receive comparable value for the cost of Advise (fees you pay to your Financial Advisor),"There are a number of different ways you as an investor pay for advice, if you have an Advisor you may pay a commission on transactions i.e. purchase or sale of stocks, etfs or mutual funds. 

Or you may have a fee-based arrangement, your Advisor earns an annual fee that equates to a percentage the total value of your portfolios. 

Or your Advisor offers a comprehensive financial plan, tax Advice or other meaningful value that impacts the way you chart your course to retirement. 

Do you feel that value you receive is equivalent or greater than the cost of the service, or do you feel like Investment Advice is only for the ultra that can pay the high fees?

&#x200B;

For Advisors that are reading this, what are the elements of service that you offer that provide far greater value to your clients that the fees they pay for your services?",8,1611519627.0,2021,2021-01-24,,etfrisk,0,l46q9c

How much money do you keep/write off when you rent out a house you own.,"Hi,

I am thinking about buying a house, then a few years later buying a better house but keeping the first one to rent out. I have a few questions on the matter

First, is how much money do you get to keep? Like if you rent the upstairs and downstairs for a combined of 3500 a month, can you turn 100% of that around and pay off the mortgage?

Second, when something goes wrong, where do you get to write off the loss? Is it capital gains?

Third, if you buy a second place, I assume it's easy to switch your permanent residence from one property to another.

Fourth, when you sell the second place, is the property subject to the same capital gains as stocks. If so this might include a loss if you lost money.

"Horizons HXS counterparty risk at 40.11% as of Dec 31, 2020","Is anyone else concerned by the high counterparty risk? It has been increasing over the last few months.

Couchpotato reports that: the 10% maximum counterparty exposure is no longer a requirement as of January 2019. And the reason the current counterparty exposure is so high is that the funds did some tax-loss selling of the swaps during the downturn in March and the subsequent recovery increased the banks’ obligations.

Couchpotato further says that they reached out to Horizons who advised the following:

Under the regulations governing all Investment Funds that came into effect on January 3, 2019, there are no longer specific regulatory limits that require us to keep the counterparty exposure with any one Bank below 10% of the net-asset-value (NAV) of an ETF, however as part of our daily processes we do monitor and assess the counterparty risk for each ETF.

If you look at some of the old and out-of-date marketing literature on the Total Return Swap ETFs, back when the ETFs were trusts and subject to the old Investment Fund regulations, we did highlight that counterparty exposure was limited to 10% of the NAV of the ETF with any one Bank.

The reason the counterparty exposure has increased for these ETFs over the last few months is due to the following factors:

1) We have the ability to reset our swaps in these ETFs when they are in a marked-to market(MTM) loss position, that is we can harvest (realize) income losses which we can use inside the corporation to offset future realized income or capital gains. During the depths of the March equity market sell-off, we reset many of the Index ETF swaps which were in a marked-to market loss position, which resulted in income losses being realized.

This is unique to the TRI ETFs, whereas we could do this fairly easily on the Horizons S&P/TSX 60 Index ETF (HXT), you can’t similarly realize tax-losses in a physically replicated ETF selling out the positions in a loss and immediately re-buying them. We essentially settle the swap and reset the index level of the new swap we enter into, which is what we did in March. It’s a key tax-advantage of our structure within the hyper-competitive index ETF universe.

2) By resetting this swaps, the affected ETFs entered into new swaps at low index levels. So you can see for example, that on HXT the counterparty exposure with all the Banks (the MTM of all the swaps in the ETF) is about 33.32% at November 30, 2020 as reported on our website which corresponds to the big rally we have seen in the S&P/TSX 60 since it’s March lows.

Keep in mind we reset HXT’s swap exposure during a period where the ETF declined nearly 44% from late February to mid-March, so the HXT swaps that we reset in March were all in a marked-to-market loss. We monitor the MTM of all the swaps daily and when specific markets or sector declines result in unrealized MTM losses for any of the specific swaps, we have the ability to reset the index exposure of the specific swaps … we can do this again and again, which essentially resets the MTM and the counterparty risk to Zero.

Understanding the Counterparty Risk:

• The current swap counterparties on our TRI ETFs are NBF and CIBC, two of the Big Six banks. We are not concerned with the level of counterparty exposure based on the credit ratings of these banks. Our swap counterparties can only be the Big Six banks based on minimum credit rating requirements. Credit risk is directly tied to the creditworthiness of these institutions and nothing else.

• This counterparty risk only exists on the ETFs that use the total return swap structure and they are in an unrealized MTM gain. We have some TRI branded ETFs now in the corporation that use physically replication, meaning they do not use any derivatives, these would include the Horizons NASDAQ-100 ETF (HXQ), the Horizons Large Cap Index ETF (HULC), The Horizons Cash-Maximizer ETF (HSAV) and the Horizons USD Cash Maximizer ETF (HSUV.U).

• As our ETFs continue to grow, we would anticipate the counterparty exposure comes down. Both subscriptions and redemptions generally lead to lower counterparty exposure.

• If counterparty exposure increases substantially because of a sudden market run-up and we deem it prudent or necessary, we can always reset certain of the swaps or add other banks to the counterparty group, which in both cases would reduce the current counterparty exposure to NBF and CIBC. All of the Big Six banks have expressed strong interest in being swap counterparties to our TRI ETFs.",9,1611502889.0,2021,2021-01-24,Investing,llamosdad,14,l41nkg

I only have $80,000 cash and $30,000 in stocks. Will the banks still give me a firm approval? I understand stocks are volatile and my portfolio value can be very different on closing date.

&#x200B;

I expect to receive an additional $20,000 prior to closing (salary, gifts, bonuses...), I just don't have it at the time of application. If all goes well I'll only need to sell $10,000 worth of stock to fund the downpayment.

&#x200B;

Do you think banks will consider stocks and future income for downpayment, or only cash?

Thanks everyone.

EDIT: people asked why I didn’t just sell the stocks at the time of application. Simple: the more money you have, the easier it is for lenders to trust and give you a good deal. I’m sure having $1,000,000 in the bank will get you better rates than having $500,000. I’m effectively asking whether having $1,000,000 in stocks will give you the same credit worthiness. Having pure cash in the bank just for that purpose would be a waste; I want that money to grow too (via stocks).

And why not sell if I need the fund anyway? Because I want the stocks to have time to grow as much as they can.",23,1611501664.0,2021,2021-01-24,,lavaboom01,33,l419ra

"RRSP - Employer Contribution, Home Buyer’s Plan and Repayment","Hey,

Got yet another question on RRSP. I thought I knew everything I need to know about RRSP, but may be not .

Example Scenario:

• RRSP contribution is zero before 2020

• Employer matches first 4K for the RRSP each year

• For 2020, let’s say I contribute 6k to RRSP

• Resulting in total contribution of 10k for 2020

• Today let’s say the RRSP value has appreciated and currently stands at 15k

• With this being less than 35k limit, I withdraw all off 15k as part of Home Buyer’s Plan

• For 2021, I continue to contribute 4k to RRSP to take advantage of employer matching it





Now my questions:

1. When filing tax returns, I can only show “my” contribution of 6k and only this is tax deductible? 

2. Irrespective of my contribution (6k), as I withdrew 15k as part of HBP, I now have to repay 15k?

3. I know I should repay starting from second year, but  can I start repaying earlier?

4. Can my employer’s match for 2021 account towards the repayment, or does this again have to be only “my” contribution?


I did read many posts where they mentioned that HBP withdrawal isn’t the brightest idea, and I sense answers to these questions might make it evident 😒

"How to ""Superficial Loss"" - Am I Doing This Right?","For visual aid, here's a screenshot - [http://prntscr.com/xjgfos](http://prntscr.com/xjgfos)

I just started doing a bit of tax prep and calculating my first ACB with [adjustedcostbase.ca](https://adjustedcostbase.ca).I'm stuck a bit with the Superficial Loss part and I wanted to throw the question out there.

So I traded [HUV.TO](https://HUV.TO) for a couple of times this year:

1. 2020-Feb-28: Bought 4 shares at $43.34 = total $173.36 (plus $0.01 comm.)
2. 2020-Feb-28: Sold 4 shares at $40.31 = total $161.24 (plus $4.96 comm.)  
**----- Captial Loss ($17.09)**
3. 2020-Mar-19: Bought 13 shares at $136.01 = total $1,768.13 (plus $0.05 comm.)
4. 2020-Mar-19: Sold 13 shares at $127.86 = total $1,662.18 (plus $5.00 comm.)  
**----- Capital Loss ($111.00)**

By my assumption, since I repurchased the stock within 30 days of buying (on 2020-Mar-19), my first Capital Loss ($17.09) would be considered as 'Superficial Loss' - thus claimed as $0.

Am I correct with this approach, and the way I did it (in the screenshot)? Would I also have to readjust the ACB of the repurchase, which changes the second Capital Loss ($111.00)?

Anyone else getting FOMO from trending stocks?,"Anyone else getting some serious FOMO right now with trending stocks such as GME, BB, GEVO, BNGO, PLTR, etc? 

Im no expert when it comes to stocks, but I know that these are most likely to have serious corrections soon. GME reminds me of what happened to VW back in 2008 with the infinity squeeze; it went to 1000 and back down super quick.

Reddit may have an army, but these are retail investors that have real money on the line. I’ve been reading people saying that they have their entire life savings on the line. Very dangerous. And scary.

Unfortunately, the top 1% control the market and manipulate the hell out of it. Though, it’s still a small win for the small group of investors.

Even after I know all of this. Some part of me wants to also dump a large chunk of change into GME. But rational me says thats probably not a good idea, and that emotional trading usually leads to losses. Any one else going through this rn ?

Edit: Thanks everyone for your inputs, I didn’t expect to get this much feedback (or award)!

Starting with the bad, I am currently in a CP with 7k left. I am 28 and was out of a job for almost 7 or 8 months in 2018/2019. I fell behind on my payments and an advisor suggested I file for a CP. The total amount of my CP was just 12k and I have around 6k of that left to pay.   


To the good part, I make around 54k and my gf makes around 62k. Thats over $100k combined. She has great credit. I have a credit card that I pay off regularly to build my credit. For a downpayment, we have around $70k available from savings and from parents. Her dad has also agreed to be the guarantor of a mortgage.

I have been at my current place of work for almost ten years.

Which Account to Use for Baby Niece's Investments,"Hi folks!
I recently became an uncle for first time. I have a deep passion for long term investing, and am looking to pass the benefits, (and hopefully the enthusiasm!) along to my niece over the coming years. That said, I'm not sure what type of account to use.

I would like to set up an account with a couple hundred bucks, buy an ETF, and slowly add to the account over the years, (nothing crazy, just 30-50 bucks for Christmas, Birthday, whatever.) I also want the option to buy individual stocks in the account. 

I don't want to use an RESP because her parents will use that contribution room, and I also want the money to be available for things other than going to school, (e.g. starting a business, life-enriching travel, or some other productive pursuit.)

What are my options? Right now I'm leaning towards just setting up a taxable brokerage account in my name that I could transfer over to her when she's 18. That doesn't seem super tax efficient, but I'm not sure there's a better option. (I max out my TFSA every year as it is, so that isn't an option either, unfortunately.)

CRA Netfile Tragedy?,"**TL; dr - NETFILE says it closed yesterday for 2016-2019 returns. Is it coming back? Does anyone know what processing times are like for a standard T1 these days? Thanks**

So, I was very late in filing my 2019 T1 for myself and my spouse. I knew we wouldn't have any taxes owing so I wasn't too worried. I finished it today and went to Netfile and was shocked to discover that Netfile closed *yesterday* for 2016-2019 returns.

 I have searched the web high and low, and I can't find any information if this is temporary or what. It just seems odd that I could have filed a four-year old return yesterday, and today i can't file a return that is less than a year late. 

Because of this stupidity of mine, I am about to see my childcare expense go up $1000 a month and I am going to wait probably an extra two months to see my family's CCB restart and tax refund: all in all a very significant hit for my family.

1. Does anyone know if NETFILE will come back shortly? (Of course, I'll be calling CRA on Monday morning)

Partial RRSP Transfer - Questrade & Wealthsimple Trade,"My work does RRSP matching, so of course I max that out. I don't want to invest with the brokerage they have it with, and I'm allowed to transfer out a few times per year without fees, but I need to do a partial transfer and leave some money in the employee account to keep it open. 

I just opened a Wealthsimple Trade account, but the only RRSP transfer option I see is a full transfer. Does anyone know for sure if a partial transfer is possible? If so, how do I go about it?

If not possible with Wealthsimple, is it possible to do that with Questrade?

best bank to start an account as an international student?,"Hi! I'm an international student going to a Canadian university (in Quebec) and wanted to have some input on which bank I should start a bank account with.

A little bit of context: I don't have a job (at least for the time being) and I'm not actively looking for one, so the only source of money I would have is from my parents wiring the money to my account. My  parents live in the US so they have US bank accounts but we're from Japan so they also have Japanese bank accounts. And since my parents do live in the US, for the summers and any holidays I would be back in the US.

I heard that TD bank is good for transferring money from the US to Canada but I've also heard it's really all the same across banks so I wanted more input!

USD to CAD conversion for down payment while house closing,"Dear Community,

We are in our condo closing phase. Most of our down payment money is in a Canadian bank in USD. For down payment amount we were asked by our mortgage broker to maintain at least the down payment amount in CAD before closing

One option is to use the Bank service to transfer / convert from our USD account to our CAD account. However, the exchange rates we are getting is very low in comparison to Non bank services. If we used the Bank service we would be ~2k lighter.

At the same time,  I am not sure how it may impact our house closing if I used a non bank service to convert / transfer between my USD account to CAD account.

Do you guys have any recommendations  ? Is using a non bank USD - CAD exchange service during condo closing worth the risk?

40K to Invest with Short Time Horizon,"I have a chunk of cash ($40k) that I would like to invest with a fairly short time horizon (2-3 years). The intent is to use the money in a couple years as part of a down payment for a house.

How are personal income tax rates calculated?,"Hi,

I have a couple questions about how the personal income tax is calculated in Ontario. 

Does taxable income include bonuses? If it does, do the basic tax and rate on excess calculated separately? 

Does the basic tax given [here](https://assets.ey.com/content/dam/ey-sites/ey-com/en_ca/topics/tax/tax-calculators/2021/ey-tax-rates-ontario-2021-01-15-v1.pdf) not include mandatory CPP and EI contributions?

Here is an example to make my question clearer: Let's say your salary is $100k and you get an additional $25k as a bonus in 2021. Is your taxable income $125k? So you will be paying $22,604 as basic tax and $25,000 \* 0.4341 = $10,852 as tax on excess?

Financially illiterate - coming into some money,"Hello!

I come from a super small town; never really had money in my life/family and am basically financially illiterate. This past year my life changed quite a bit - moved to a large city in Canada for a job, lost that job during covid, and ended up finding something with a large scale company that just went through IPO. Part of my employment contract was an amount of RSU's - 25% will vest in Nov of this year. The rest will be released over the next 3 years. The current value of the options is the largest amount of money I would have ever had (assuming the stocks stay at that value, or continue to rise over the next few years which I believe they will once life returns post covid).

I am trying to figure out what to do. The 25% that would vest this year would likely get me out of all my immediate debt and then give me a solid amount of savings which would act as an emergency savings fund for a year.

I don't want to waste this opportunity if I can figure out how to invest that money and maybe turn some quick profits from it on the stock market. I really don't know a lot about this stuff - but I want to change my life (stop wasting money on material things) and use the RSU's to make some serious bank.

Without getting into stock market strategy (not the point of this post), does anyone have any feedback or opinions on what I can/should do?",2,1611438819.0,2021,2021-01-23,Investing,PriorSilver,0,l3li9q

"Questions on RRSP Loans offered by banks, and also on tax returns + housing market","Hi everyone, I just logged into my banking account today and saw that I had an offer of $5k to put into RRSP at prime %. I have a TFSA account, but I never dealt with RRSP before. Is this an offer I should jump on? CRA says my 2020 RRSP deduction limit is about $88k, and I'm not entirely sure what that means. I'm familiar with how TFSA works though, and my contribution room there is about $55k.

I usually make about $110k gross at my job, but my income was reduced for 6 months in 2020 due to the virus situation, so my 2020 gross income is probably around something like $80k (haven't received my T4 for 2020 yet). My common-law partner is a teacher and she probably makes about $80-90k gross per year. If I take the bank's $5k RRSP loan offer, how much am I expecting to get back as my tax refund? I am already planning to utilize the T2200 form on 2020's tax return to further reduce my taxable income for 2020. I am a renter so all the expenses on T2200 add up to about $4k for 2020.

One another question I had with tax returns is that I was used to receiving $2k-3k easily on tax refunds when I was single, but as soon as I declared my marital status as 'common-law', the refund amounts were \*significantly\* reduced. It has been about 3 years since then, and I have consistently received less than $500 in refunds. Is this because my partner's income is now also considered as 'mine' and now I am put in a much higher tax bracket? I use HR Block online to file my taxes. I always input my information there first so I'm giddy about receiving $2-3k in refunds after I finish entering my information, only to be disappointed to see this amount significantly go down once I finish entering my partner's information there. I'm not sure if this is a common occurrence or not. 

Anyway I am asking all this because my partner and I have been having discussions on purchasing a home & starting a family etc. Where I live (Toronto), the housing market is insane so let's just say we are looking at about $750k for a 2 bedroom condo downtown/townhouse - which means $25k (5% on $500k) +25k (10% on 250k) =50k minimum down payment. She has about $25k she can put towards the down payment right now, whereas I don't really have much (less than $5k in liquid assets). A simple calculator tells me that a $750k property will run about $3800/month + monthly condo fees with minimum down payment. We are currently paying $2400/month for the rental so that's a huge sticker shock for us (not to mention our monthly cashflow isn't good enough to support 3800 + monthly condo fees). Even if we do decide to go for it, that means I will have to come up with extra $20k in loans just so that I can even have an opportunity to purchase something. Are down payment loans something commonly offered to people nowadays? It's a ridiculous idea at least to me. If I do sign up for this down payment loan, that means this will further reduce my monthly cashflow correct (3800 + monthly condo fees + down payment loan repayment)? My partner and I literally come from nothing so we do not have the 'bank of mom and dad' to rely on like a lot of people have been. I just feel like I'm stuck in a situation where my partner and I make 'too much income' to even qualify for the 5% down payment top-up government program (or any kind of assistance program), and we can't really move way out to the countryside (because she's a teacher so she will have to eventually go back to school, whereas I can work from home anywhere) so we are forced to rent/purchase in this expensive city.

I have a few questions though for which I wasn't able to find a clear answer on the internet, and sometimes the fiscal jargon is confusing me. Hopefully someone here will be kind enough to explain to me like I'm 5. :)

\*\* I live in Quebec \*\*

1- Capital expense

If I understand correctly, those expenses aren't deductible, or creditable, or anything, is that right? For example, if I buy a shed for the house, or pave the driveway with asphalt, or buy a fence, I won't have any taxe deductions or financial help of any sort for these expenses?

2- Maintenance

Is it the responsability of the tenant to mow the lawn, or shovel the driveway? If it's the responsability of the landlord, if I pay someone to clear the snow and mow the lawn, do these expenses qualify as current expenses?

3- If there's anything else you think is worth mentioning, please do! Especially for everything related to the fiscal side of it, as it's the part of it that is still a little obscure to me.

"I want to designate a part of my only property as primary residence while living elsewhere, do I need to change my addresses to it?","If you have a house and you rent out a portion of it (60%) and keep the other portion for yourself (40%), I suppose I will have to pay capital gains tax on 60% of the house when it's sold, right?

Now, my 40% portion is more so a vacation home, I will ""ordinarily inhabit it"" but I won't be living there full-time. So realistically, my main residence is elsewhere (I don't own that property or any other property), so ideally I want to keep my address at my main residence, not this vacation home. 

So my question is, if I don't change my address to this vacation home, and the tenants pay all the bills (because I'll be there very little) and utilities will be registered in their name, so I won't be deducting any utilities from the rental income because the tenant is paying that directly. When I sell the house, how will I prove to the CRA that 40% of the house was my primary residence? Won't I be screwed over if I don't have any ""proof"" that I ordinarily inhabited that 40% of the house? 


Or is it a better idea to change all my addresses (drivers license, CRA account, healthcare etc) to that vacation home even though I don't live there full-time? 

And in terms of utilities, how should I handle it? Keep it in my name? Or tenant's (let's say tenant is agreeing to have them in their name and pay 100% of it)? If I keep it in my name, wont it still be suspicious if I deduct 100% of the utilities from the rental income from CRA's perspective?

Of course, as self-employed, my income is not completely reliable, but again, it is more likely that my income will be higher in the future than it is now, so I am not sure if withdrawing from RRSP in the future will have much of a tax benefit for me.

My TFSA is already full, and I have stock investments both in TFSA and in a non-registered account. I expect these to grow, and create a larger passive income for me over the years. As such, I am again not sure if my earnings (the non-registered ones) in the future will ever be less than they are now. 

I have already purchased my first property, so I cannot withdraw from RRSP to purchase a property one day, from what I gather. 

So what is the benefit here for me of contributing to RRSP, as opposed to just paying tax on the income now and investing the money in a non-registered account?",47,1611426213.0,2021,2021-01-23,,JamesVirani,0,l3hd0y

TFSA Contribution room question,"Hi everyone,

I am sure this has been asked but after reading multiple threads on this I just would like some clarification.

If my TFSA contribution room on January 2nd is $10,000 and I buy exactly $10,000 worth of Microsoft  shares. Microsoft goes up 100% in a week because of amazing earnings and because I think it’s going to drop after I want to sell all my shares / money invested in the company.

So now I have $20,000 in my TFSA ACCOUNT.

1) Do I have any contribution room left for 2021?

2) Is my contribution room $20,000 now in 2021 and I can throw $20,000 in Apple on January 24th?

3) what happens if I don’t have anymore contribution left and I did sink the $20,000 into Apple 


These are just hypothetical questions as I have not done this but I’m just curious after reading a lot of these threads. Thanks in advance!!",13,1611424511.0,2021,2021-01-23,Investing,MarcAuroni,0,l3gxh0

"Non-resident, how to invest besides TFSA?","Bit of a tricky question.
Currently living abroad, and have been for 4 years. 
I just found out non residents **cant** contribute to their TFSA.



Unfortunately I wasnt in a financial place to put money in my TFSA before leaving, and now i'mprohibited from doing so as im not currently a resident.



Currently looking to start investing my cash a bit better, and wondering what the best vehicle to park it in is (since i cant use a tfsa)

Current assets:
200,000CAD cash

Approximately 50,000 canadian in foreign cash

160,000CAD of company stock options and RSUs (vested, hkex)



Im relatively open to risk, and was planning to opt for 80/20 (mostly either xgro or vgro)

So core question, with that 200k cash, should i just be using a non-registered account to purchase ETFs and sit, or is there a better option?",6,1611422375.0,2021,2021-01-23,Investing,d-crow,2,l3g870
T2200 rent deduction with partner,"So my employer is going to be sending us T2200 forms since we've been at home since March and will be for at least another year. Currently my partner and I pay 1575 total for our rent but I pay 865 and she pays 710. We split this based on square footage of the house because I use our spare bedroom as an office and workshop.

We're both on the lease but I'm wondering what do I declare on the T2200. Can I only declare that I'm paying 50% or our rent or can I can I claim paying 865. There's no written agreement between us or any party on my paying more. Additionally, what do I do about claiming hydro bills, do I only put 50% of the hydro in the form or do I put the total cost for the whole apartment (we split our utilities and everything else 50/50).

Cheers.

Edit: residing in Quebec.

Edit2: since there's some confusion and people are downvoting for some reason I don't expect to be claiming all my rent and hydro. What I mean is the government asks how much you paid in rent over the course of the work from home. Do I put the total rent my partner and I paid, or only my portion? And if so can I put my 865 portion or can I only say I pay for 50% of the rent since we're both on the lease and it doesn't say anywhere one of us pays more.",9,1611421942.0,2021,2021-01-23,,tilerthepoet,2,l3g360
Most aggressive Scotiabank fund,"Hi there, I am new here and I'm currently looking to make a few changes to my investment portfolio, since my brother told me I was investing in ""geezer funds"".

I currently auto-contribute at each paycheque to the Scotia Diversified Monthly Income Fund and Scotia Canadian Dividend Funds in my RRSP and TFSA. I am not investment savvy myself, so trading on my own is not an option, and all the financial advisors I've talked to at Scotiabank seem to think these funds are the best options for me, but I'd prefer to take on something a bit riskier.

About me: 32F, unmarried, no kids, no debts or loans. I live in Vancouver so won't be buying real estate any time soon (lol 🤣). I have a full time job with a small pension, on top of my TFSA and RRSP contributions. In fact COVID has allowed me a small cash savings nest egg but what to do with that is another thread for another time.

Capital Gains tax question on severed building lot,"So I’m considering selling my primary residence but prior to, I’m also considering having a building lot severed from the main property and selling that too.   I’m wondering how much capital gains tax I would have to pay.  

Originally bought the house for 185k
Sell now for 525k
Sever lot and sell at 250k.

I realize I wouldn’t be paying capital gains on the house, but I’m wondering about the lot.  How would the capital gains tax be calculated?  Using the original price of the house purchase or just the selling amount of the lot?  Is it spilt in half and then using my income/tax rate to calculate?

Example cost of living in Toronto during the pandemic as a single,"For anyone who's planning to move to Toronto or curious to see how they stack with others, here's my spending data over the past year (2020) and the four years prior. 

TL;DR: you need at least 40k net (52k gross) to live by yourself and have some extras on hobbies/fun, while saving nothing (which I would not recommend!)
This is 4k lower than last year, because housing (rents) came down hard and all the expensive entertainment is closed. However, groceries went up by quite a bit so I'm not spending less on food even though I ate out less.

I live alone and have uncomplicated tastes. I bought a condo in 2017 and rented prior to that; the location allows me to remain car-free, using [Communauto](https://toronto.communauto.com/) when I need some wheels. I do not make an effort to be particularly frugal.

Everyone's situation is different; more than anything, your mileage may vary on any money issues. But it would be interesting to see similar breakdowns from others, figure out where I might be overspending, figure out where I could be allocating more. Feel free to ask any questions.

There is a market rent comparison since my housing costs no longer accurately represent the situation of someone who just moved to town. At market conditions, it definitely pays to rent in Toronto in 2020.

Reducing capital gains when switching portfolios,"The way my portfolio is set up right now is absolutely fine for me, it is set it and forget it whole world low-fee and so on. However, I've recently realized that there is a way for me to lower my fees and FWT drag which will save me a fairly significant sum over my investment lifetime.

With my current portfolio, I have an unrealized capital gain that I will have  to pay taxes on when changing the portfolio structure, so I'm trying to figure out what the best way to make the move is, with the following options seeming to be available:

1. Wait for a market downturn that will bring the portfolio closer to where it started (ACB-wise) and then move sideways to the other portfolio structure, thus reducing the capital gains hit.
2. Move part of the portfolio over each year until a large market downturn occurs and then complete the transition, to keep the marginal rate as low as possible each year while also minimizing what I'm losing each year in fees and FWTs.
3. Move now, realize the capital gains hit, and then hope that there is a downturn 30+ business days from now that I can sell into for tax-loss harvesting partners, wait another 30+ business days hoping the market doesn't go up substantially, and then sell again sideways to realize at least some of the loss and nullify the initial gain.

Of the three options, the first is my preference. I don't like the third because it seems too clever to me and relies on three good outcomes happening in a row (which seems unlikely). I don't know how efficient the second option would be.

Any comments or other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

To buy back pension?,"Hello PFC,

Wife (35) has an offer to buy back just over 7 months of pensionable service for $9050.   It’s a defined benefit pension.  As she’s buying back non contributory service from pre full-time, it’s not matched.  

She plans to stay with her employer for life.  Her wage will increase at least $5/hour in the next couple of years before she tops out at her level, not counting cost of living adjustments.   Pension is indexed.  

I assume she would retire at 55, but could be 65.  

The calculators show she would increase her monthly pension, based on today’s salary, by $75/month both before 65 and after.  This means in ten years she would recoup the initial investment with no thought to how it would grow elsewhere over 30-40 years. 

Being so far from retirement myself, I feel like I’m clearly missing something other ways buying back this time would pay off.  

Before we pay $9050 (which we’d get $2550 back in tax refund) is it worth it?  Are there other ways that $75/month spread grows over time?

Thank you!",6,1611385581.0,2021,2021-01-23,,AFinancialFlunk,5,l37efa
Should I be incorporating so I can deduct the startup costs as I return to my old/second career?,"Hi all,

Happy to hear any advice at all about my current situation.

I've  been a musician my whole life. Years of formal training, with a return to further training in 2021. I've done bits  and pieces of paid work when I was a student, playing wedding gigs, session work (that's where you record parts for other people's songs), etc. The money wasn't enough to live on but I have the skill set of a professional musician and have earned income from that career in the  past. I have experience running a home recording studio and used that  studio to get a small amount of paid ""remote session"" work in the past.

The  thing is, I more or less put music aside for 14 years to pursue a career in healthcare. The vast majority of the income I've made in my life ended up being through that.

But, life happens and I've been disabled in a way that has forced me to leave the healthcare field and reexamine multiple areas of my life. I'm fortunate to have disability insurance and am not in danger of losing the roof over my head. I've got an ""own profession"" rider, meaning I won't jeopardize my insurance by working in another field; I'm eligible so long  as my health prevents me from returning to my healthcare career (which  will be the case for years perhaps, but hopefully not forever).

Mercifully, my disability doesn't prevent me from writing, recording, and playing  music on the instrument I've trained on. For over a decade, I've regretted  letting music take a back seat, and I definitely need to be working for the sake of my sanity, so I want to put a positive spin on my  circumstances and get back to working in music.

I'm  planning to set up a new home recording studio (my old gear was sold years ago) and seek whatever work I can find - songwriting, session  work, mixing and mastering audio. It's going to be a one-person show,  with me doing everything, and probably needing to do a bunch of unpaid work to build referrals and a big enough portfolio to attract paid clientele.

Music gear isn't cheap and while I have some of what I need, I'll have some significant expenses as I get myself set up, including some renovations to a loft in my home that will be a dedicated work space. This is the type of work where the first year has way higher expenses than subsequent ones, and I'm realistically guaranteed to operate at a loss for 2021.

I  won't have any personal income I'm hoping to deduct against in 2021 other than  what little work I'll get as I get set up (my disability insurance is not taxable income), but my hope would be to carry forward the losses from this initial startup cost and deduct that against my income as it hopefully picks up into 2022 and beyond. Some time in the future, there may be an overlap where I'm able to start working in healthcare part-time again in some capacity, but I don't intend to stop  working in music. I intend for this to be a lifelong change. I mostly worry that, if and when that happens, I could be accused of using losses from a ""hobby"" to offset income from my other career if I've been operating as a sole proprietorship.

Is this a situation where I need to be spending the money (and time/effort) now to incorporate? I'm not even sure if that's the answer, since you would typically charge for recording, editing and production work under the name of your studio or production company, but collect pay for things like remote sessions or online music lessons under your own name, so I'm not sure a single LLC could even be used to cover the breadth of my artistic endeavours (whereas the musical equipment and studio renovations are used directly in all of those and it seems appropriate to apply them as an expense against all those sources of music/studio-related income). I've read about the criteria the CRA uses to  distinguish a hobby vs a business, and I'm worried that, in the short term, it'll look like I'm trying to deduct a bunch of expenses for a hobby, when in reality it's just an abrupt shift from a profitable career back to a less-profitable one with high initial startup costs. There is an honest expectation of profit on my part (and I'll be working on it full time, since I don't have my old ""day job""), I'm just realistic and know the net profit won't be happening until 2022 and beyond based on my business plan.

I've already arranged for one consultation with an accountant who was so  confused by my situation that we spent a half hour talking, and then he never even invoiced me his fee because he said he had no idea what I  should actually do. So, I figured I'd take a stab at anonymous Reddit advice before trying my luck with other accountants.

The path of least resistance is to accept that I'm out of pocket for everything, but since I'll be paying tax on the income I generate with my equipment, it seems like a poor financial decision to do that.

Any advice is appreciated. This is a huge change in my life and I want to do it as financially responsibly as I can. I'm in Ontario if that changes any answers.",4,1611385580.0,2021,2021-01-23,,canuckunstuck,3,l37ef8

Should I Drain My TFSA to Pay Off Debt?,"I think I know the answer to this, but since I'm relatively new to the personal finance world and come from a family that approached money differently, other opinions are helpful.

I currently have about $9k of debt on a credit line with a moderate interest rate. Right now, I anticipate about 12-14 months to pay this off in full, unless my work gets hit again with the pandemic, sooner if more work comes back. However, I have enough sitting in a TFSA savings account to pay this off in full, though it would leave me with only a few thousand left as my life/retirement savings.

In addition to this, I have an emergency fund built up of about 4-5 months living expenses. This I won't touch because my income is not guaranteed (though usually consistent) being self-employed and that safety net helps when I get shut down or have a particularly bad month.

I've read all the advice that floats around this and similar subreddits and I know now that it would have been smarter to clear that out earlier on and built up the TFSA later. But would it be better to go and just pay that off now and take the savings hit or would it be better to stick with my current pay off plan?

Smith Manoeuvre & ETFs,"I'm in the process of learning and planning my execution of the Smith Manoeuvre.

Is my understanding correct that for the purposes of the manoeuvre, a dividend ETF would be preferred over an asset allocation ETF because of 1) preferential tax treatment of dividends from Canadian companies and 2) less accounting/micromanagement due to return of capital distributed by an asset allocation ETF?

My next question is, should I be buying an ETF at all or should I just buy the underlying companies of whichever ETF I intend to track? The benefits would be no MER but would I have to perform more accounting due to receiving dividends from multiple companies vs the distributions of a single ETF?
Seeing as the balances get quite high, the MER on an ETF seems like it would be quite a drag.",11,1611365982.0,2021,2021-01-22,Investing,FruitPirate,3,l32bom
Neo Financial,"Neo Financial is out. I installed the app, though I have no immediate plans of ordering a card. I mainly was curious what kind of vendors gave bonus rewards. The plans are unusual. The basic free plan is 4% cash back at participating vendors, and 0% back everywhere else. Then for $5 or $10 a month, you can add 1%/0.5% or 2%/1% on top of those 2 buckets.

Obviously the 'everyone else' rewards are dismissible. It's less than pretty much any card, but the rate at partner vendors (4-6%) is notable. Looking around my area, I was surprised that there were actually a pretty high number of partners. Several dozen vendors within a few blocks of me (including my local coffee shop half a block away). It's definitely not everyone though, and 0% on everyone else isn't much to catch the eye. It seems to be questionable as an only card, but could make a good second card if you know where to use it or now.

edit: I'm wrong, the claim is an AVERAGE of 4%. I saw some places offering 1%, but other places 10% and so on.

Saving for parent’s future needs,"Hi everyone!

Does anyone has experience or advice in saving money for their parents’ future medical bills / retirement? This is a topic me and my sibling started to discuss not so long ago because we know our mother will need our financial assistance when retired. As many people here in Canada, our mom immigrate here to give us a better future leaving everything behind. She overworked to provide for us and, unfortunately, that led to her having health issues that will have long lasting effects.  

We talked about saving $100/mo each and are looking at a roughly 20 year horizon before we use this money (this is just an estimate). Our main goal is to save enough for when our mom needs assistive care (e.g., nurse at home), money for medicine, etc.

Personal Finance On-Line Education - Ontario,"Hello All,

I have recently received an inheritance from my mother's estate. (~$220 000)

A family member has suggested that I take an investment course. They provided these links:

https://www.csi.ca/student/en_ca/home.xhtml

https://www.ifse.ca/courses/

They have no investing experience and simply googled for these results.

Are there any other worthwhile sites that you suggest? Thoughts on the sites I linked above?

Background:

I am a 54-year-old male renting an apartment. 

Education: Some college - I have a Cooks Apprenticeship Diploma

Work History: 15 years cooking / 15 years Manufacturing - Food

Recently separated (1 yr) and am still working out the spousal support payment I will receive. (~$3500/month). Will also receive ~$40 000 from property settlement.

Two biological children - Adults

One non-biological child - Adult

Currently in receipt of CPP Disability (~$1100/month)

~$80 000 in RRSP with RBC in a ""Select Conservative"" Mutual Fund (Pension rollover from when the plant closed and I lost my job)

I have enrolled in the CPP-D Vocational Rehabilitation Program. I have yet to choose a ""path"" but ultimately my preference would be a non-physical/stay-at-home profession. It would be nice if I could incorporate my retraining with an investment slant. Any suggestions? 

Essentially I am starting over at 54 years old and feel the need to make good decisions with what I have at hand. 

Please feel free to share your thoughts...

How do CPP/OAS/GIS interact with the Disability Tax Credit?,"A company called True North Disability contacted my mom said they think she's eligible and they can help her apply for the Disability Tax Credit.

I'm digging into it and my understanding is that they'll help her with all the paperwork and what not and then take 20% of what she gets as a result.

Looking further, it seems to me that it's not terribly complicated and she can do it herself.  From what I can tell she should be eligible to claim this credit when she does her 2020 taxes so long as she gets her doctor to fill out the appropriate form and get it approved by the government.

Now...  all that said...  the part I can't figure out or find information on is how this actually affects her. The end result seems to be to ""claim the disability amount of $8,576 on your taxes on line 31600"".  What does that actually do?

Her only income is CPP/OAS/GIS so I doubt she's paying that much in taxes in the first place and since it's a tax credit, she can only get back what she puts in.  I honestly don't know how much she pays in taxes but I bet people here know, as it's pretty much the same for every senior in Ontario that doesn't have outside income.

Finally... am I right to assume that this won't impact her eligibility or payments for GIS because this isn't income?  This will just mean she pays less tax so it shouldn't impact any income testing for GIS, right?

Thanks guys...  I did my best to figure this out on my own but rant into a wall at the end when trying to figure out how it all works together.",6,1611362091.0,2021,2021-01-22,,WildWeaselGT,1,l316ft
Any suggestions? American/Canadian living in Canada,"Hi everyone!

"Mortgage Broker Rates - Jan 22, 2021","Happy Friday everyone.

There were some rate drops this week, so I wanted to share the best rates we (mortgage brokers) have access to.  When shopping around for rates (with you financials institution or brokers), keep these rates in mind for some guidance.

Purchases - If you're buying a property, rates start at 1.39% 5-year fixed and 1.30% 5-year variable.

Transfers - If you have a mortgage already and it's coming up for renewal (or you simply want to break your current mortgage for a lower rate), best rates are 1.30% 5-year variable and 1.44% 5-year fixed.

Refinances - If you want to borrow more money or extend your amortization, rates start at 1.40% 5-year variable and 1.54% 5-year fixed.

NOTE: I am definitely a big believer in variable right now.  Rate is lower, due to COVID rates aren't expected to increase and the penalty calculation is capped at only 3 months interest (cheaper than fixed).

If anybody wants an exact quote, simple answer the questions below for your transaction only.

 For a **mortgage transfer/renewal**: 

\-How much is the mortgage owing?  
\-Roughly, what is the current market value of the property?  
\-Which city is the property located in?  
\-Is the property owner-occupied or a rental?  
\-Who is your current lender?  
\-Do you have a HELOC tied to the mortgage?  
\-Is the mortgage CMHC insured?  
\-When did you buy the property?  
\-When is your renewal date?

For a **purchase of a property**:

\-What is the purchase price?  
\-How much is the down payment?  
\-Where it the property located?  
\-When is the closing date?  
\-Will the property be owner-occupied or a rental?

For a **mortgage refinance**:

\-Roughly, what is the current market value of the property?  
\-What is the current mortgage owing?  
\-How much do you want to borrow (refinance)?  
\-Is the property owner-occupied or a rental?  
\-Where is the property located?  
\-When do you want to close on the refinance?  
 

Whenever you are borrowing MORE money than currently owing or INCREASING the remaining amortization period, it is a refinance.",109,1611356139.0,2021,2021-01-22,,MortgageSense,20,l2z9i2

Advice on Car Loan refinance,"Preface: So, I know it was a bad idea to begin with but we desperately needed a car and had no savings to buy a beater.


Back in January of 2020 my girlfriend and I had to purchase a car. At the time she wasnt working and I had not the greatest credit (the loan was put only in my name because girlfriend was not working). We ended up getting a 2017 Hyundai Elantra, our loan was with Scotiabank, our paperwork shows a total of $19,539.86 at 16.99% for 6 years (72 months), our bi-weekly payments are $200.58. The used car dealership we got it from called this week and advised we can refinance our car at a better interest rate because we have not missed a payment on it. So I went to put my girlfriend on it because she is now working and I figured that will help lower the interest rate because she has a student loan she has been paying off religiously for the past 2 years. Apparently we can get our car refinanced at 11.99% for 5 years (we did not want to extend our loan term).


There was a few things that I am confused about. First, apparently the sales manager (who we have been dealing with) said that her student loan isn't a good loan, even though everyone I have spoken with has said the opposite. Second, if we were to have just me in the loan the interest rate would drop by about 2%, because the student loan apparantly isnt a long term loan, yet its set for a 9 year repayment plan. Something sounds a bit off.


Previously my girlfriend had credit issues, it is now good and has been for the past 2 or so years. The student loan is in very good standing and there are a few bills in her name now. Were not set on having her on the loan, we were advised last year (by someone else at the used car dealership who doesnt work there anymore) that it could potentially help. My credit is ok with the car loan as we have not missed a payment but I got screwed by Capital One and they didn't call me back during lockdown to see what I can do to pay off my card (about 2500, which is hard on CERB we couldnt make that work at the time) and sent it to a lawyer now Im paying $50/mo for the next 5 or so years. I'm getting that dealt with as soon as I can, likely once I'm back at work.


 This whole process has taken a few days to get sorted out with a lot of phone tag, I'm not sure if that is normal or if its a red flag. Initially they said we could do a trade in which is why I think they initialy called but also advised we could refinance, we are happy with our car and wanted to do that instead.


If someone could shine some light on our situation it would be greatly appreciated. The guy we have been dealing with has been kind of a d*ck since we didn't want to trade in our car and just refinance. I just want us to get the best interest rate and have lower payments.

Advice on handling finances after a death,"EDIT: To be clear, my aunt died a couple of days ago. This isn't a theoretical situation. I'm just trying to figure out how to navigate this legally and do my best to wrap up her affairs.

If there's a better sub for this please point me in the right direction. My aunt recently passed. She has no partner or children. I lived with her as a teen so we were quite close. I'm not sure but I believe I'm her beneficiary, which might not apply if her policies haven't lapsed.  My mum (her sister) and I will be taking care of everything. I'm not confident she has a will. She had some chronic illnesses and was on long term work disability. I'm not sure if she was paying all her bills and insurance coverage. So there is a good chance any policies she's had have lapsed.  Were planning to give notice on her apartment, and go through her tax paperwork (Probably several years haven't been filed).  Any advice on steps to take to wrap up her finances?  I'm pretty concerned about outstanding debts.  Her ""boyfriend"" (aka the leech) owed her over $20,000 but I doubt we'll be able to get it back.

Any websites we should check? We're going to start sorting through her paperwork soon. I've never really dealt with a death like this firsthand. I want to approach it in a way that makes sense. Thanks!

Question: Tuition tax credit for source reduction Quebec,"Hi everyone, I’ve been going back and forth with my company’s payroll department all day and just hoping any tax expert here can help me with my question:

1. I have unused tuition amount of 59731.93 from university, that gives me $4778.55 (59731.93 x 8%) tax credits.

2. I got an letter from Revenue Quebec stating that I am entitled to “non-refundable tax credit of $4778.55.”

3. Sent the letter to my employer and today when I checked my pay, the tax didn’t reduce much. My employer replied that they used 4778.55/25 (missing the first pay period) = $198.8 and that reduced my taxable income by $198.8. 

If my research was right, shouldn’t the $4778.55 reduce the Quebec income tax dollar for dollar since it’s not like basic personal amount?

Bad credit score help," 

Disclaimer: english is not my first language so sorry for any mistakes or bad grammar. I also use a throwaway because I think it’s too much info on my main account. 

Ok, so I just saw my credit score for the first time. It was not good (630) and I saw that I had a credit card debt that went to a creditor agency. I am a moron and I did forget about that card, it was not with my usual bank, not my principal credit card, and I moved soon after and never received a letter because I did not change my address and basically forgot about it (because I am a moron, again). I took it at the time because of a promotion.

I freaked out and paid it all today after contacting the bank (it was around 600$). The only other stuff I have is a credit card  with a 2000$ max that I pay each time I use it, so my balance is 0,00$ practically all the time. I have that credit card since before the other one that I forgot about. Those two credit cards are the only one I had. I don’t think I paid interest once on my normal credit card. I also pay 40$ every month for my laptop (it’s taken from my bank account directly).

Will my score improve since I paid that debt and in how much time? I just wanted to check my credit and cancel my Equifax account, but I will keep my account oppen to see if my paiement helps. Also, I am not sure If I use my credit card correctly to improve my score. Should I use it more? I use maybe 100$ or even less each month when I think about it or buy from Amazon, and I pay it immediatly after. Should I use it more and is it ok to pay it off immediately after? I don’t need a loan or anything, but I would like to improve my score and do what is possible right now.",5,1611352862.0,2021,2021-01-22,,InformalConfidence57,0,l2y647

Can we afford this house?,"Account is a throwaway for obvious reasons. Looking for a sanity check before we make the move.

* We live in BC and have 1 child.
* Age
   * Me - 28
   * Partner - 26
* Income
   * My partner is a french immersion teacher making approximately $70K/year right now ($4,300/month net for 10 months - no income in the summer). 
   * I work for a crown corporation earning $86K/year right now ($5,200/month net).
      * Both of our jobs are union and we each still have several ""steps"" to move up in the pay grid each year until we max out and our only raises will be for inflation. Current max for me is $100K and for my partner is $87K. I will be at max in 2 years, and my partner will be at max in about 5 years.
      * We both have Defined Benefit Pensions that will be maxed in our mid 50's that will provide 70% of our highest years earnings indexed for inflation.
   * I am currently working from home, but if I return to the office I will be able to walk to work from the new house.
* Assets
   * We have $120K cash from the sale of our apartment (this is after realtor fees/legal fees/etc).
      * We got very lucky that we were able to buy our apartment in 2016 with only $10K down (our family's are not wealthy and were/are not in a position to help)
   * $14K in RRSP's from previous jobs (currently in XEQT)
   * $40K in TFSA's (XEQT)
   * 2016 Toyota Corolla with 40,000 Km's - value of around $14.5K. We won't ever have a second vehicle - prefer to bike when we have the option.
* Liabilities
   * None
* The house
   * New build - $640K after GST - will have new build warranty and hopefully minimal maintenance for several years
* The plan
   * Plan to put $75K as a down payment
   * Keep $20K in emergency fund (EQ bank)
   * Keep additional $15K in EQ for bills/travel (will probably put more into TFSA's once we are more comfortable with the monthly spend).
   * $4K to our TFSA's
   * $2K to our kids RESP.
   * $8K to furnish new place
* The mortgage
   * $2,550/month including property tax at 1.74% with First National

After all of our housing expenses and childcare we should still be able to put $1,300/month into our TFSA's, save $1,000/month in EQ, and will still have around $2,500/month left over for spending. Our typical monthly spend is about $1,200 (excluding child care) including gas, food, diapers, etc.

Our hobbies are very cheap - running, walking, biking, reading, floor hockey (pre covid), dodgeball, etc.

Can we afford this?

Dental School Line of Credit for US Dental School,"Hi All,

I have appointments lined up for CIBC and BMO in the coming weeks to discuss potential lines of credit for dental school. I am wondering if I am even eligible for a Canadian line of credit though? I am a Canadian citizen, but I have been living in the United States for the past 6 years or so. I no longer have a permanent address in Canada, although I do have a close relative who lives in Ontario. 

The interest rates are just so much more reasonable through the Canadian banks. I got into a pretty cost efficient dental school (I also received some merit scholarships from them) so the whole line of credit of 300k CAD will cover tuition + cost of living for all 4 years (even when taking into account the exchange rate). That 2.5% interest rate + prime - 0.25% while in school seems so much more reasonable and manageable than the 6.6% and 7.6% rates from the American government. 

Is there a catch? Will I be eligible?",6,1611347962.0,2021,2021-01-22,,zdoq,0,l2wi17

The Problems with the Financial Advice industry - From the Inside.,"Hey all,

&#x200B;

Just one of your resident anonymous financial advisors here. I wanted to lay out some information that many of you may find helpful.

For reference, I run a wealth management firm & personal income tax firm. I am IIROC licensed, life licensed, have a BBA degree and hold the CFA designation & a litany of other useless titles. This account is anonymous and is not being used to find clients, I simply ignore any DM requests related to this.

I know there is a massive hate for financial advisors here, and frankly its well deserved. 

I wanted to talk about the problems with the industry, why they exist, and why most people have a bad experience with a financial advisor.

Let me start by prefacing this and saying that I fundamentally believe 90% advisors are salespeople, 5% are scammers and 5% are actually doing a good job for their clients. 

Now, let's talk about why 90% of the advisor are salespeople. Well, 90% of the clients who work with advisors have small accounts & as such pay very little.

Let's consider a median account size, of say $20,000 in a banks investment products. You might think that's low but seriously what do you think the average Canadian has in investments? It's likely this is in a bank's product charging a 2.3% MER. But for this example, lets assume the advisor is independent and makes nothing on the banks end of things. Out of this 2.3% the advisor is likely paid a 1% trailer fee. On $20,000 that would pay a gross commission to the advisor of $200. Now, the advisors firm is going to take a cut of that, and it's likely around 40% (More successful advisors pay a lower rate, we pay 20% but average is probably 40%). Meaning the advisor gets $120 per year in revenue to manage this account. 

Now this $120 is before they pay their staff, their rent, software costs, phone bill, internet etc etc etc. Meaning that the actual gross profit an advisor might make on this could easily be less than $50. Their team may spend anywhere from 3-10 hours per year on this account. Meaning at the high end they make $16.67 an hour and on the low end $5 per hour.

This is what causes such a problem in the industry. In the first place, the vast majority of Canadians are not willing to pay for financial advice. Even if they desperately needed it. If the advisor tried to charge an hourly fee or anything along those lines, it is likely the % fee would be substantially higher for the client at the end of the day. 

So what does an advisor do? Well most advisors forgo spending a ton of time promoting good advice and rather collect as many accounts as they can. Since they are making next to nothing per hour of work on the smaller accounts, they have to offset this by making more on larger accounts. 

This is fundamentally why the majority of financial institutions do not bother fully training their financial advisor staff as it is nearly impossible to be profitable for them providing proper financial planning and advice to the majority of the population. They train them to sell profitable products instead, as the products can be profitable while the advice industry is not outside of the High Net Worth segment.

&#x200B;

This leads to the population that most needs proper financial advice, being unable to receive it and receiving crappy advice and expensive investment products instead. As it is the only method that major financial institutions have found to make this demographic profitable. 

Since the majority can not afford proper advice, they receive crappy advice. Since the majority receive crappy advice, the industry as a whole provides crappy advice. The industry receives a bad reputation, which it deserves.

&#x200B;

To give you perspective, this is what I do with a $100,000 client:

We meet for 30 minutes to interview for the first time. They book a second meeting of an hour to go over the details, what we charge etc. They call us to confirm they want to move their accounts over. We send them a list of questions we need answered so we can prepare the paperwork. 

We spend 1 to 3 hours preparing the paperwork depending on the complexity. We then sit down and meet with the client for another hour to go over and sign off on the paperwork. We then arrange a phone call or meeting to go over the clients financial goals and objectives. This is usually an hour. 

Then we spend 3 or 4 hours preparing a financial plan for the client to reach their goals and objectives. Then we spend an hour going over the financial plan with our client. It likely requires some revisions, so we spend an hour making alterations to it. We then spent 30 minutes reviewing the amended plan with the client. 

If the client approves, we then design an investment portfolio to meet the return & risk objections from the financial plan. Average of 3 hours, some take 15 minutes, some take 20 hours+ depending on complexity. 

From there we sell off their existing portfolio, and buy their new portfolio. Which takes 2 hours on average. Once that is all complete we spend up to 2 hours reviewing the accounts to ensure all the money has arrived properly, the portfolio was purchased accordingly and no errors or omissions have taken place. Then we prepare the compliance paperwork for the portfolio which can take an hour. 

So far, 19.5 hours spent. $100,000 pays us 1%, and our dealer takes 20%, leaving us with $800 or $41 per hour. Now remember, this $41 per hour is simply my revenue. I have full time staff, rent, software costs, standard office overhead (heat, phone, internet). My share of business expenses run at about $48 per hour. My rent is only $600 a month as my business partner owns the building. Most advisors likely have a higher overhead than I do.

So for this client, it has cost me $7 per hour to provide them with proper financial advice. Now, it is likely that the number of hours required yearly after this drops down to 10 hours a year. The only reason I even take on an account of this size is if they are saving regularly and I can see their account being worth $500,000 in the future as that would allow me to be profitable for managing their account. 

This is the entire problem with the financial advice industry. The regulatory, compliance, administrative overhead costs are so high that I can only provide proper advice to those that already have enough money. The result of all the excess costs designed to protect consumers, is worse and worse advice being given to those that need it most.

&#x200B;

This is why the majority of financial institutions provide crappy advice, & use high fee products. It is why if you can learn to manage your financial affairs you should. However many people should note that simply because your situation is easy to learn  does not mean it is easy to learn how to manage every single persons financial situation. 

Even with that being said, every single piece of research I have ever read has shown that investors behavioural biases detract from performance more than high fees do. Every investor assumes this is not them. Most investors are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Spend the time learning how to invest properly, do it yourself and the majority will suffer behavioural pitfalls detracting from performance.  Or get lumped in with an advisor who may charge you too high a fee, receive low quality advice, but potentially eliminate some of your behavioural pitfalls.  Roboadvisors can work for some people, but I still see people making behavioural mistakes with roboadvisors. Waiting to put money in until the markets at a ""good point"", or changing their risk tolerance at terrible times. 

&#x200B;

This is not to say that I am complaining as an advisor, or that you can't find a good advisor. These are all generalities and are not applicable to every situation. I can only speak in broad strokes as your situation is likely unique. I make a good income for my level of qualification and have no complaints. However I see the average advice provided by my industry and it appalls me. Its why I understand the hate for my industry in the general community. 

&#x200B;

Let me know if you have any questions, I would love to discuss potential solutions to these issues.",346,1611347592.0,2021,2021-01-22,,CFAsmalltown,1331,l2wdhg

Employer group RSP contributions,"First off, a big thank you to everyone that contributes here. I'm learning a ton and while I'm not yet ready to DIY manage things myself, baby steps.

I'll be contributing to my new employer's retirement matching plan in a few months. They will match 50% of what I match, up to 3%. I am planning to contribute 6% to get the full 3% match. I can and want to contribute more to my retirement, though and wonder where to put the extra.

**Option 1** is increasing my payroll contribution to 10% (or possibly higher) rather than 6%. My concern here is that I assume the fees through the group RSP plan (Canada Life) are higher than what I would incur with Wealthsimple.

**Option 2** is taking my extra and contributing outside of the group RSP, i.e. via Wealthsimple.

Because contributions are pre-tax with option 1, I believe my net pay will be slightly higher with this option. I'm also hoping to make extra payments to my mortgage, so this higher net pay would allow for those extra payments.

But with option 2, I'll receive a tax refund for my contributions and I can use that refund to dump onto my mortgage once a year.

Any pros/cons you can think of with going one way versus another?

I have RRSP contribution room due to being a putz and not heavily contributing up to this point.

Paying down credit debt with RRSP,"Hi All, 

I live in BC and I earn around $80k/year right now.  I have $3888 in RRSPs and will be depositing another $4500 - provided by company.  

I'm thinking of paying down some of our credit debt (mine & wife's) with what I will have in my RRSP.  I know it's not ideal, but I feel like all the money I pay into our credit cards just gets put to use again.  My RRSPs are earning a lot either - maybe around 4-5%.  They're with Coast Capital Savings at the moment. 

We do have a budget and I can tell you all honestly that we spend too much on dining out.  Even with that, I'm still able to pay around $700/month to two credit cards. Total debit on both is around $10k.  I do have other debts of my own, but my main concern is my wife's debt right now. 

Would it be worth drawing from my RRSP to pay off around 65% of that $10k debt?

EDIT: Just some clarification regarding my RRSPs. They're paid directly to the RRSP account by my employer.  $80k/year is my OTE.  Salary is $63 +.  I'm in my ""leaner"" months right now due to winter.  This is where my sense of urgency comes from.",8,1611344280.0,2021,2021-01-22,Debt,japaul32,1,l2v8e5

Am I wrong if I start a part time temp job when I don't intend on staying for the full alloted time?,"I just got hired for a temp job in a warehouse working part time (basically an 8 hour Saturday and occasional other hours, since as a universigy student I gotta work around classes). I'm specifically a ""part-time limited-term"" worker. My paperwork says they're allowing me to work there until December of 2022, but realistically I don't anticipate staying there that long.


They're just the only place that responded to me recently and I need something in the way of income. I plan on moving on to a better job sometime but figure I'll stay here for minimum 7 months; likely will until April of 2022, but if I find better work I gotta take it because I'm in school ""for the long haul"" as they say, and I have an expensive diabetic cat to take care of. 


If I'm there for a while, and I'm sure to do a notice of 2 weeks to a month, am I still okay contract wise? I'm a little confused about the limited-term regulations, but I didn't see anything in my papers about me not being able to leave early or something. Further, does it seem likely that they'd be willing to give a reference provided I'm a good worker if I leave earlier than they anticipated?

CERS Fraud,"I have a commercial rental property and recently I talked with my tenant, a small business owner. I have to saw he's always been current on the rent, throughout his almost 3 years there and including this pandemic. 

He mentioned how he applied for, and received, CERS. As far as I know he definitely qualifies. Well he also mentioned that in order to pay rent in full and cover some expenses he actually stated online that his rent is higher than it actually is. After our conversation I checked online how CERS works and he can get 65% plus lockdown top up, so almost 100% of the rent. 

The thing is the reason he told me this is, as he said, in case he ever needs proof he'd like me to write  a letter stating rent is his reported amount and not what it actually is. When I did the math it looks like he's getting 140% of his actual rent. 

I told him I have to speak with my husband, just to end the conversation, but I'd never write that false letter. Any tips as far what I should do?",6,1611340702.0,2021,2021-01-22,,Michelle_H_MMH,3,l2tz5o

Recommendations on reporting Easyfinancial to proper authorities?,"Recently I posted about Easyfinancial, and how I declined the application after they called to confirm my details.  I realized their monthly interest rate was way higher than my weighted average is now, which was the reason I cancelled.

They called a second time, and hey, mistakes happen, so I politely declined a second time.

I get a third call, and it's obviously a retention sort of person, trying to tell me why in fact 3% per month is a better deal than 10% a year (what I currently have).  I was getting annoyed, and eventually got him to understand and he hung up.

Cue the fourth call a few days after that, now I was very annoyed.  I cut him off immediately, told him I talked to three people, please cancel my application and make a note in my account I do not want this application any more.

Today, about a week or two after that was done, I get a fifth call.  All pretense of politeness out the window on my part.  Told her, I have received four calls already after my application, and I had told the first person I cancelled.  I told them I asked them to put a note before, and she said there was none there, and she will put another one.

Honestly now, I don't care if they call or not call any more, but I do want to know who the appropriate regulatory authorities are I can contact, federal or provincial (I'm in Ontario).  Thoughts?

Housing low interest interest rates and amortization periods relationship,"Why doesn't the government reduce maximum amortization periods from 30 years to 20 ? This would counter balance the low interest rates stimulation and prevent the crazy increases in house prices. They did that in 2008 and 2012 when max periods were 40 years and went down to 35, then 30, then the current 25 for insured mortgages. 

Some people will say this will erode affordability, but that's not true, because people would qualify for smaller mortgages which makes them not go into bidding wars in the first place and force them to save bigger down payments, and at the same time prices won't increase like they did for the past 10 years because 20 years amortization got a much larger payment than 30 years. By forcing people to save more, their debts will be much smaller and they don't have to take the crazy debt risk like they are doing these days.

"From a primarily financial perspective, if you had one year to retrain, what would you do?","Short version: A lot of the retraining discussions I've seen tend to lean into either ""follow your passion"" or involve getting a degree or diploma that would take 2-4 years. Those can be great options, but I'm interested in thinking about it if the drive is more finance than passion and if there's a stricter time limit.

&#x200B;

Long version: I have a couple of friends who are thinking of retraining after doing the stay-at-home parent thing but can't afford to do it for longer than a year. And thanks to the covid situation, have a couple of other friends who have been recently laid off, and received a decent but not extensive retraining fund as part of their severance. Everyone involved is between 35 and 50, so their original education is years ago and none of their educations were in practical fields like engineering or medicine or the trades.

So given the opportunity to take a one year program with no set prerequisite education, what would you do if there were no other concerns other than a one year limit and with a reasonable ROI on the education?

And full disclosure, my personal interest is that I'm working for my father's business while it's in shut-down mode and should be finished within the year. So I'm watching my friends' plans with an eye to copy their successes/avoid their failures.

Mechanics of budgeting,"I have a financial system set up where all paychecks go to a savings account. Fixed expenses like housing and investments are paid directly from this account. Day to day spending is from a checking account or credit card account funded by a biweekly transfer from the savings account. When the savings account gets too full a manual deposit into investments is made.

This system works great for regular life because it automatically invests and pays our bills. But fails when we have random big expenses like car tires and Christmas. I find most budgeting schemes suffer the same shortfalls.

If I make early payments, am I just reducing the amount owed from the 44k or am I actually lowering my interest bill so that the vehicle loan, in the end, would be less than 44k? The car is being financed through Scotia Bank

Lost in a world I'm just now setting foot in,"I have recently finished my degree, landed a well paying job, and have cleared my depts (Education and car). Growing up we were taught to save aggressively since our family didn't earn much. I was fortunate to have a bank account from when we lived in France at 3% interest which for the last few years I transferred all my savings too. I recently had to close the account since I was about to make a house down payment but my partner and I decided to wait longer. So I am now sitting on **45k** (Excluding a **5k** emergency fund), and my 3% account is closed. Our timeline is now looking more like 4-5 years or more for a house. I have done a lot of research and was looking for feedback on my current plan. A little about my situation: my job comes with a pension which I am expecting to be around 70-80k a year which I can touch at the age of 42, I am currently 23. 

My planned income (Before pension/tax deductions) for the coming years is something along the lines of:

|2021|62 500|
|:-|:-|
|2022|67 000|
|2023 - 2030|79 000 - 95 000|
|2030+|107 000+|

I Have **34 000 TFSA** contribution room. I currently have both a TFSA and RRSP with CIBC investors edge. From what I understand the exorbitant fee of 7$ is not worth it if I were to open a TFSA and RRSP with Quest trade in order to invest into ETF's there since they have no fees. ***Am I allowed to open both a TFSA and RRSP with quest trade even though I have them opened with CIBC***? Do I need to even bother closing the accounts?

I do not spend money monthly on anything except rent/insurance/internet/netflix/climbing gym membership and food. This leaves me most months with 1500$ or more to save/invest. My plan was:

**Maxing my TFSA**, and continuing to do so yearly investing into: 

* 100% XEQT until I am at least 32

**Contributing** 500$ a month into an **RRSP** investing into:

* 100% XGRO until I am at least 32 then moving into a less aggressive position such as XBAL

Continuing to grow my house down payment in a HISA in 500$ monthly increments.

If starting today that would leave me with:

* 34000 in TFSA + 500$ monthly contributions
* 500$ in RRSP + 500$ monthly contributions
* 10000 in HISA for down payment + 500$ monthly contributions

I've been following this board for awhile now and have learned quite a bit so far. I'm hoping I can get some insight from you gurus :) 

Here is my current financial situation:

1) $20k in debt - low interest debt (5-7%)

2) $8k in checking account

3) $12k in group RRSP (employer match 50% of my 8%)

"Question about ""Child care expenses"" for income tax purposes","I'm looking for information (or even just opinion) about what constitutes Child care expenses for income tax purposes. The [CRA](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-21400-child-care-expenses/line-21400-what-child-care-expenses.html) defines them as eligible if they are incurred to allow a parent to do one of the following:

  

* earn income from employment
* carry on a business either alone or as an active partner
* attend school under the conditions identified under [Educational program](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-21400-child-care-expenses/line-21400-who-claim-child-care-expenses/line-21400-educational-program.html)
* carry on research or similar work, for which you or the other person received a grant

My situation is that my wife stays at home, but normally incurs a modest amount of expenses for things like day camp and the like. She sent the kids to day camps a couple of times when schools were closed for teacher walk-outs a few days at the beginning of last year here in Ontario.

She hasn't had employment income for a while, and didn't receive any of the coronavirus assistance in 2020. She does have a small amount of income she reports on her T2125 from a (very small) business.

The business is pretty passive, but obviously it requires some amount of time to administer, do paperwork, whatever. She doesn't track her hours, but it's a pretty trivial amount of time. If the question is ""does she conduct work for the business while the kids are in these programs?"" the answer is ""sometimes"" (her answer to me).

My question is: **is there any kind of a test at all as to whether costs were incurred ""to allow"" someone to earn income? Or is having some amount of income reported on a T2125 sufficient to make the costs eligible?**

The amount of expenses are measured in hundreds, not thousands, of dollars. I don't think I'd be flying in the face too badly of the spirit of the thing if I claimed the costs, but by the same token will continue not to claim them if there's a chance she'd one day be asked for some documentation of what time she spent working on the business, since no such documentation exists.",8,1611326800.0,2021,2021-01-22,Taxes,ReadyTadpole1,1,l2p5tf

We're both debt free thanks to fortunate circumstances. I now have a stable income, and been saving aggressively to no particular goal (thanks 2020), and have a 3 month safety net, that doesn't alter current lifestyle. I plan to pay for the tuition.

The plan is to submit a TD1ON form with my employer and retain a common law partner amount, and then transfer her tuition credits over to lower tax owed. The reason is that transferred tuition credits are non-refundable, so I'd rather increase tax owed than pay out of pocket. Does this sound reasonable, or have I missed something? See math below.

Also wondering if there's other forms that might help me do this to claim an amount directly towards tuition, rather than as a spouse amount... and if there's any consequences to moving from ON to Alberta for her school.

We're trying to avoid debt if possible - we're looking into zero interest grants, but don't want hope on it. She's not eligible for scholarships because she's a second time degree pursuer.

Books - saving from now + part time work
Laptop - saved for by the time school starts.
Tuition yearly = ~8k /year
Credits claimable - 5k/ year
Spousal amount claimed from employer - 10k/ year minus any income she'd make during school.
Living expenses already accounted for because I live there too and pay rent anyways.

CanWise Mortgage Broker vs TD Mortgage Specialist,"I'm looking to get a new mortgage soon and I'm wondering on what are the differences using a volume discount broker like CanWise vs a mortgage specialist at a bank like TD. I already have a long family relationship with my TD mortgage broker, but he offered me a rate of 1.89% when I asked him and the rates I am seeing from CanWise are 1.44%-1.78%.

Requirements:

* 30 year amortization
* Bridge financing
* Low Ratio (30%+)
* HELOC

I am just looking for the best rate, I don't really care if it's fixed or variable as BoC has said they are keeping the rate low for \~5 years? But I must have bridge financing and the CanWise guy told me some of the discount brokers with the best rates don't offer it.

Is it better to go with a CanWise broker to try and get the best rate or use my TD mortgage specialist? I think the CanWise broker will end up going to Scotia or TD anyway since I think only the big banks offer bridge loans.

Oh I think I should also get a HELOC so I can execute the Smith Maneuver. So my mortgage would also have to offer that. I know TD has the FlexLine.",8,1611324966.0,2021,2021-01-22,,may_be_indecisive,1,l2ol1l

Question about where to park 100K for short term... Tangerine?,"So last summer my mother gifted me 100K for my wife and I to help put a down payment on a home. It ended up falling through, and our search eventually fizzled out. I don’t anticipate needing it for at least 6 months, though don’t want to take on much risk to be safe. So I was thinking of parking it in a savings account. I know the online banks don’t exactly give you immediate access, but I think once we start looking seriously again, I’ll transfer it over to a big bank for quick access in case needed. 

So I was looking around at promotional rates and saw Tangerine for 5 months @ 2.1. Not had. I tried Googling some answers to these questions but could t figure it out so I’d figure I’d ask here. Please let me know if wrong sub. 

1) Is Tangerine the best shot term option?
2) How do I get the 100K to Tangerine. I could get a draft but I’ve never banked with Tangerine before. I don’t mind a hold, even an extended one, but can I do mobile or ATM deposit for that amount? Do I have to send it in or something? Will this cause any flags (I can provide months of statements if necessary haha).
3) When the time comes to withdraw the funds, I’ve heard that they can send you a draft. I imagine the cost would be in the 7-10 range, but how long would it take to arrive?
4) Any other info I’m missing?

What can we afford?,"
- S/O and I are house hunting in Eastern Ontario (outside of Ottawa)
- ~$70k combined take home (after taxes)
- Applied for a mortgage and have been pre-approved for $475k with a $25k down payment (up to $500k asking)
- Found bank foreclosed home that is gorgeous. We absolutely love the bones of the home. Roughly ~2400 sq ft.
- Listed at $440k. Since ~November based on listing pictures
- Considering offering 410k.
- Have another $20k in stock portfolio that can be sold in February after blackout period
- Additional $7k in RRSP

My main concern is the cost of utilities to heat and cool the home throughout the year based on the size. Very open concept, built around 1988 or 90s. Bungalow. Natural gas furnace. Radiant heated floors, humidity controlled air exchange, and AC. Natural gas stove. Hooked up to municipal. Hot tub as well.

I'm anticipating utilities all in to be ~$1000 dollars
$150 for our cellphones
$70 internet
$800 gas, hydro, water..which is where it tightens up our cash flow. With this budgeted in along with $550 in car costs (payments, insurance + gas) and $650 groceries we have a little over $1000 leftover to save, and $500 left as free cash flow for anything else.

Am I rounding up too much with my numbers? Does this sound like a decent debt to savings and available cash flow ratio?

2. If the house is somehow still available in Feb, do i add my RRSP and $20k in shares to my down payment?

Edit: The agent git back to me and confirmed the previous owners were paying $110 fixed rate hydro. Gas they couldn't determine but they called a neighbor with a house similar in age and size and they say they spend $92/mo gas. The agent says this is right in line with the $200-250 they spend a month on hydro + gas and they too have a hot tub like this home.

Does this sound right? My $800 calculation sounds way overpriced.",36,1611298807.0,2021,2021-01-22,,thatsdirkdiggler,3,l2iafa
How would you negotiate for a raise?,"Just trying to get some ideas on how to best approach my situation(read below). Things I should keep in mind when asking for a raise and how to best prepare myself before hand.

&#x200B;

Just some background on my situation:

I want to ask my boss for a 2$ raise this year, going from 28$/hr to 30$/hr. He already gave me some bonuses here and there,also he buys lunches sometimes and also picks me up for work everyday. We had a ""deal"" last year that he was going to give me a 2$ bonus for every hour I worked that year, paid at the end of the year.(So it's like I would be getting paid 30$/hr technically) I worked 700 hours so he had owed me $1400 at the end of the year but he went back on his word.. ( We didn't sign any agreement) He said he already gave me enough bonuses throughout the year, so I wouldn't be getting it.(Those extra bonuses were not part of our original deal, he just gave few bonuses as the year went along)He even brought it up a few times throughout the year that I would be getting paid 30$/hr. Also I am 1 of only 2 employees who work for him, I have 10 years experience in the industry with 3 years in his company(Since it's inception, I was the first one hired). Meanwhile my 1 co-worker is like 3 years experienced in the industry and only 1 full year working at the company yet he gets paid 25$/hr. So im only getting like 3$/hr extra than my co-worker despite me having triple the experience and I do all the main task. My co-worker is mostly my helper.  We both show up for work everyday, and didn't take time off. Is this bull crap?

We are 3 months away from starting the new season and I have yet to negotiate anything with him. How can I negotiate for this 30$/hr considering that's what I was technically supposed to get the year before?

Employer matching RRSP,"My employer has a 100% RRSP matching plan through Sunlife.

Are there any problems if I do this? Are there tax issues?

So I owe 33.7k for my loan currently and am getting conflicting messages on how to correct spend my 18k of savings.

Well fast forward a couple months and some back and forth and I get a letter saying I was rejected, so I call Amex again and now they tell me they can't verify American income and that I should have only put my Canadian income (which is literally 0).

Which is correct? Has anyone in my situation successfully gotten a good credit card? I don't want to apply again and get another hard pull for no reason. Thanks!",13,1611278678.0,2021,2021-01-21,Credit,adastranaut,7,l2cscc

PayBright - 0% for 24mths,"I feel like I'm taking something when I'm looking at PayBright.  What's the point of 0% financing on stuff?!

I can get PayBright for 24 months for 0% at like $65/mth.  What am I missing here?   It's as easy as just taking my $1500 and holding it in a HISA (ok, like 2% right now) and I would end up ahead with these payments, no?

What are the downsides?  I have great credit, living in my dream home with like 60% equity, have a reliable car (2-3 years from next one)... I have no need for this, but I've always been told if you can get a 0% loan, take it.

Used Car Financing,"Hello PFC,

One day, when we're back in the office, my family will have to get a second car, so I'm now trying to do some financial planning - we're thinking about getting a two to three year old Japanese car. 

When the day comes, I'd like to be able to enter the used cars dealership with some kind of a pre-approval to avoid being ripped off by a financial ""manager"" there. 

Am I correct that it's better to call the local CUs and a couple banks in order to get a good rate? I saw something like Canada Drives, Car Loans Canada etc., but they all seem to be tailored to the people with a less than stellar credit it and will probably charge something like a 10% interest on a used car financing.

"Buying my first car, new or used?","I'm looking to buy my first car in a few months to a year, and have recently been able to save a decent chunk of money, about $10000 currently with an additional 1500-2000 a month if nothing unexpected happens. In a year hopefully I'll be able to get a higher paying job in the field I studied for and move out so the situation might change then. When I do buy a car I'd like it to be the only vehicle I have to purchase in a loooonnggg time, preferably until the thing dies or just isn't safe anymore. The Toyota Corolla Hybrid looks like a decent car for me, nice tech and safety features, fuel efficient and Toyota has a reputation for easy maintenance so it seems like a good long term choice.

My dad's been saying it'd be smarter  to buy an older vehicle as to save money on insurance, and then to buy a new car once I'm earning more later on but that doesn't make much sense to me? Would insurance savings really be that much to offset the cost of having to buy a whole different vehicle and whatever associated maintenance costs? It seems like it'd make more sense to just get a new car now and hold onto it for as long as I can.

I won't be buying a car for awhile still but I'd still like to hear some other opinions so I can mull it over.",26,1611274284.0,2021,2021-01-21,Auto,ricewizard15,8,l2bge2

Should I break my mortgage?,"Looking for some advice. I signed my first mortgage back in December 2018 and signed a 5-year fixed rate mortgage at what turned out to be the worst possible moment. My original rate was 3.34% but in August 2019 the lender (MCAAP) offered to ""blend and extend"" to get it down to 3.14%. This essentially means I renewed for 5 years at no penalty for a rate that was in-between the current rate and the rate I was paying (current rates were like 2.7% at that point).

So now here is my current situation:

Mortgage Rate: 3.14%

Remaining term: 3.5 years

Current Balance $380k

My broker has offered two options:

1. Break mortgage altogether for $21,138. Broker quoted me 1.35% for a new 5 year fixed. By my math this works out to almost a wash over the remaining term, the advantage would be getting 1.5 more years at this rate if mortgage rates increase between now and then.
2. My lender has offered to let me break the mortgage for $5900 if I sign a new 5 year fixed at 2.44%, again the numbers work out fairly similar as they're just covering the rest of the penalty with the increased rate

When I do the math both options do put me a little bit ahead, but I'm not sure parting with $21k cash is something I want to do.

Do either of these make any sense? or should I just accept that my timing was shit and wait until I have less term before making any changes?

Thanks!

Edit: my math on the interest:

5 years at 1.35% + penalty = $44,353

5 years at 2.44% + penalty = $48,246

3.5 years at 3.14% = $40,440 +anywhere between $7,000 and $15,000 over 1.5 years depending on interest rates in summer 2024",6,1611270398.0,2021,2021-01-21,,lomac92,2,l2a7ud

I'm about to change jobs and relocate to Gatineau. When is the best time to talk to a mortgage broker given my situation?,"I've been working consistently since finishing grad school several years ago. We are both in our late 20s. I'm about to take a job in Ottawa that pays $65k with the federal government and is a one-year contract. My partner and I are relocating from SW Ontario and plan to stay in the area for at least five years. We are already familiar with the area as it's closer to family. Based on the direction of housing prices I have no interest in renting and are also sick of renting in general.

I know that buying on a one-year contract is a bit risk but I'm looking at purchasing something pretty cheap and having savings to fall back on. My partner is also finishing grad school and will be looking for work in the next few months. I expect her to make $50-60k out of school.

Here are our financials:

* $80k liquid (me), $25k her
* $20k in DB Pension (me)
* $15k+ in other assets - paid off car, expensive instruments, etc.

We're looking at buying a stacked townhouse in Hull for around $160-200k. We're also considering detached houses for a bit more than that but don't really mind. 

I'm thinking of putting 20% down, which would allow us to keep $40-50k after closing costs, hopefully. 

Here's the thing: I still have a lease in SW Ontario. I'm thinking of giving notice, which would mean we'd have to move out in March. 

My last day at my current job is Feb 5, and my new job starts on Feb 15. I do have T4s for the past several years. There's no set probation on the contract. My parents live near Gatineau so my partner and I could stay with them for a few months if need be. 

**Based on our situation, when should we start talking to banks or mortgage brokers?

Building credit and credit cards,"I'm having some troubles obtaining a credit card and I'm hoping the fine folks of reddit may be able to help me out as to why or how to obtain one. 

For some backstory, my fiance and I are in our early 30s and are looking into purchasing a home. We have a joint bank account and credit cards and want to do it together. I've had multiple credit cards in the past which I got rid of, typically as they expired, and I focused on living a student debt free and card free life. My partner had multiple cards and as the need for cards become necessary we would use them. Then she got a couple new cards in the last few years and I subsequently got one as well. This whole time thinking they were joint accounts like everything else.

That is the mistake we made. We were talking to a mortgage person recently and my fiance's credit is really good and mine is trash. This is because ever since I got rid of my cards I have NOT been generating any credit rating. The credit card accounts we have are not joint as we suspected.

Well, that sucks but no problem I thought. I'll get a card or two and I'll build it up. But I keep getting refused and I don't know why.

"CRA phone line doesn't work, and my CRA account's locked. Please help.","UPDATE: I eventually succeeded after a week of trying. So what I did is I connected to the line about online account (not about the lock) that has less wait time than the line for the lock issue. Eventually a person received and he transferred me to the unlock specialist. This transferring worked well because I only had to wait for an hour before connecting with someone. 

I also contacted the general CRA line because my CRA candidate profile login got locked. The error message web page asked me to call the general CRA line. However, I noticed after talking with the agent that the general CRA line is actually wrong and that I should call the CRA job opportunities helpdesk to ask for unlocking the account. Apparently the error message webpage showed a wrong phone number. If you have the same issue with the candidate profile like I did, just call the CRA job opportunities helpdesk.

Hi everyone, 

I forgot the answer to my security questions, which made my CRA account to become locked. I got the CER.097 Error message saying I need to call their general helpline: 1-800-959-8281. 

I've tried calling them on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday this week. Called them right away at 9 AM. Several calls have been rejected with the statement ""Our queue is full.""   


For the calls that made it through, I stayed on hold for 3 hours, and after that, the call hung up with the automated CRA voice saying that they are unable to take my call and I should call later. There have been 4 times when I was on hold for 3+ hours each.   


This is driving me absolutely insane. It's the worst nightmare, and I've been extremely stressed about this. I've done tons of google searches about this issue, and I see some posts saying they were able to talk to an agent after 1-2 hours on hold? Like how is this even possible? What helped them to talk with an agent after only a few attempts in such a short time?   


I'm literally beginning to wonder if my phone number is a type of phone number that CRA tends to ignore. I know there are call centres in BC too, but maybe BC less likely to receive more support due to their timezone.   


Is there any way to increase the chance of me talking with a live agent? I'm definitely waiting for more time on hold compared to the call wait time posted on their website. Is there a different phone number than 1-800-959-8281? I don't want this insanity going on for weeks",14,1611267891.0,2021,2021-01-21,,sparklesinthesky,0,l29e6w

Credit Question,"Hey all! 

Edited to add: If this shouldn’t have been posted here, I apologize. It looks like I’m getting downvoted so I assume that’s why? 

A bit of background to get us started:

A few years ago I was faced with two items that went to collections for non-payment. The items in question were two Visa cards. In February 2019 these debts were paid (under $2000). I received letters from collections to indicate these have been paid. They show as $0 owing on my credit report. 

Here’s my question:

While the collections debt shows as $0 owing on my report, the two Visas still appear under revolving credit on my report with the balances owing.

I’ve read and been told conflicting information. I’ve been told these amounts are being looked at when considering my debt utilization, even though they’re not open or owing. 

One person told me once to contact the bank that the Visas were with and ask them to remove these. But I’ve had no luck with this, no one will even talk to me about it at the bank. They just say they have no idea what I mean. 

Can anyone help me navigate this? 

I understand these were my own mistakes and recognize they may just have to stay there until they are removed naturally. That said, I’m worried about how they’re displaying and since some folks have advised these can be updated, I figured I’d ask!

RRSP Contribution limit room vs deduction limit,"I know I'm not the first to ask this sort of question, but I can't seem to find the right information.

I've been working for a few years now, but I've only opened an RRSP 3 years ago. I haven't used all my deduction nor contribution room every year except for 2020. My income has changed over the years due to moving, taking a sabbatical, etc and I wish I had started putting money into an RSP 5 years ago. 

I understand that my **deduction** limit is a rolling number that changes from year to year, but does the **contribution** limit add up (kinda like in my TFSA)? So, if my 2016 NOA said that I could contribute $XXXXX, can I put more money in this year despite having hit my deduction limit? The CRA's website is unclear as the RSP section mentions 2020's deduction limit, but past NOA's mention a contribution limit as well.

Resources to start investing/trade? Starting to care about finances,"Hi all!

Some backstory: I am new-ish to Canada (under 5 years), currently on a 40k/year job. Never had much clue on how to maximize my money.

Details:

My spouse and I are new(ish) to Canada. Currently only I have a G license; they have a G1. We don’t own a car but are wondering if it’s time to buy one...hence this post.

Spouse works ~25km away and has continued to work in person throughout the pandemic. This is not likely to change. I have been WFH since last March, which is also not likely to change anytime soon. Spouse currently gets a ride to work for $50/week, and we use a carshare membership for errands, appointments, and as an emergency backup if Spouse’s ride is canceled. (We used to use public transit but have mostly stopped since Covid). Carshare consistently runs us about $400-450/month.

Someone Fraudulently Cashed a Cheque Issued to my Husband (MB),"My husband and I reside in Manitoba and our auto insurance corporation, MPI (Manitoba Public Insurance), issued refunds by mailed cheque to many policy holders due to lack of vehicle claims in the spring. My husband is the only driver, but did not receive any kind of refund and assumed that maybe he didn't qualify for some reason. We weren't too concerned and just waived it off.

Fast forward to this winter when MPI put out a notice for a second wave of refunds issued by mailed cheque. All of a sudden, we receive a cheque in the mail. So my husband called MPI today to inquire if he had originally qualified for the spring refund and to let them know, if he did, that he never received a cheque.

Turns out he did qualify, they did send out a cheque, and it was cashed back on June 9th. We are 100% confident we didn't receive or cash this cheque. Other than providing the cheque number, the dollar amount, and the cash date they gave us, MPI is unwilling to help further with this and are brushing this off like they do not have a responsibility to aid us. 

Any ideas what steps we can take to make this right? Would filing a police report put more onus on MPI to rectify this for us and do their own investigation into the fraud? Is this something our own bank can assist with?",3,1611261455.0,2021,2021-01-21,,jaykay921,2,l2767h
Renewing my Mortgage,"My wife and I have lived in our current house for 4.5 years now.  Last month Scotiabank reached out to let us know we can early renew our mortgage with them, they offered us prime -1% on a 5 year variable term.  I discussed it with my wife and we agreed that was a good deal and I emailed them back to let them know we accepted.

Scotiabank got back to us and told us they made a mistake and that they were unable to renew a variable rate mortgage more than 6 months before the date the mortgage comes due (this was 7 months prior)  They said they would be back in touch in a month.

I reached out to them yesterday and they said the best they can offer now is Prime - 0.88.  Why would there be such a large change in such a short amount of time?  I don't think lending rates have changed in the last month and our credit situation hasn't changed.

When I spoke to a broker they said most lenders won't give us their best rate because we only have a $170,000 mortgage.

[Update] Move from GTA to Calgary,"Hi PFC, I made a post here 2 months ago inquiring about moving to Calgary from GTA and buying a bigger house there. [https://old.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/jx8vw9/sell\_house\_in\_gta\_and\_buy\_bigger\_house\_in\_calgary/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/jx8vw9/sell_house_in_gta_and_buy_bigger_house_in_calgary/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

&#x200B;

I wanted to provide an update and ask more questions. It looks like I may finally pull the trigger around mid-year this year. My company is going to allow me to work from Calgary or surrounding area, company has an office in Calgary too. 

&#x200B;

My intention is to sell my house in GTA and that will allow me to buy a larger house in Calgary/Airdrie. I want to be able to be mortgage free or if I will need a mortgage in case I find that perfect house which is a bit out of my liquid cash reach, then I would aim to pay it off in less than 5 years.

&#x200B;

How should I handle the sale and move, anyone who has made such a move, can you give advice on what to do when selling and specially how to handle the move? I have close family in Calgary with whom I can stay for a month or two while I find a home. So in that case, I was thinking to sell in GTA first and then move my belongings to Calgary and put them in storage while I search for a house? is this the best way to do it? This will be a 3 bedroom townhouse worth of items, very minimal furniture.

Anyone whos made such a move can they also let me know what to expect for moving expenses, such as the charges from moving companies? And any recommendations from experience for companies who handle long distance moves?

&#x200B;

I would also like to know what I should take care of when ""cutting ties"" to Ontario, address changes, drivers license change, updating address on cra etc, anything I might be forgetting about?

Feel free to ask any clarifying questions if needed.

&#x200B;

Edit: Forgot to ask, where should I search for moving companies? A friend of mine got shafted by a scam moving company from Kijiji and I do not want to go through the same thing.",18,1611258721.0,2021,2021-01-21,,kl0pkl0p,2,l267b7

Car payment is burning a hole in my pocket,"I needed a car daily for work until the pandemic, but have been 100% WFH since March and will be 100% WFH through 2021 and possibly forever.

I have a 2019 Nissan Sentra SV, 5 year lease that began in Oct 2019, monthly payments of $305, insurance of $184/month, gas/repairs have varied a lot but at least 150/mo.

I'm spending $650/month on a car that I don't really need anymore. I initially went with the lease as I wanted the reliability of a new car as I had started my career, but I'm thinking since I will not be doing a commute or anything and just need it for pleasure-use I'd be better off buying something used between 5-10k with cash and saving the monthly car payment. I think I'd be spending about 250-400/month on car expenses (ins/fuel/repairs) vs 650+ minimum now.

Advice for moving out or staying with family [Ottawa],"Hello, long time lurker, first time poster. I am finishing up my last term in university and will immediately start working full-time as a software developer. My starting offer is a $90,000 salary with $45,000 in stock options to vest over 3 years. I live in Ottawa.

Having done software dev co-ops throughout school, I am fortunate to have about $20,000 in savings and only $19,000 in federal/OSAP student loans. I own (with no debt) a 2016 Honda Civic which I pay $230/month in insurance for. Right now, I live with family (2 aunts and their daughter) who I pay $500/month to. I do not pay for my own food, internet, power, etc. By and large, I am extremely fortunate to be in my current situation.

I'm looking for advice financially and just generally regarding moving out. My aunts are happy to have me as long as I would like to live here. (came here for a co-op and have stayed throughout the pandemic). However, I have been thinking more and more about getting my own apartment after I graduate. My job will have me working from home on a permanent basis, and as such I would want either a 1 bedroom + den or 2 bedroom apartment so I can have a separate office for working. Furthermore, I want to live close to downtown / on the LRT line so I can get downtown for post-covid fun. I also have to contend with paying for parking.

This is all a lot of background, so now to the numbers. How much should I be spending on rent costs based on my salary? I've heard the 30% rule, but is that in reference to gross or net income? 

Another element I have to consider is that from living with roommates during university, I do not own much furniture / things to setup my own apartment and would need to buy it myself. Things like basic furniture for a living room, a new bed (I'd like a Queen sized), bookshelves, etc. I generally like buying quality goods that will last me a long time, but that definitely increases costs. I know nothing about buying furniture other than IKEA.

I know in terms of pure numbers, I should stay with family for as long as they'll have me as $500 in total living costs is pennies compared to what I'd likely rent for plus paying for my own groceries, heat, etc. I've been dreaming of having my own apartment for years, after living with uni roommates that weren't as clean as me. While that's not the case with my aunts, living with a 3 year old toddler does come with its own challenges. There's also another baby on the way due in September. Living with them has been a blast, but the daily tantrums and banging above me (my room is in the basement) can be very grating some days. I think that about wraps up my verbose post.

My employer isn't deducting taxes.,"Shortly after starting to work for my current employer, the Federal Government, I filled out a TD1 form since I was still a student at the time. This was in May 2019, I attached the form to an e-mail and sent it to compensation with a message stating that I had enough student tax credits to cover any tax owing. My initial contract was only for 4 months, so I was not going to even cross the basic personal allowance regardless.

&#x200B;

They obliged and have not withheld any federal or provincial taxes since, though CPP and EI are obviously being taken off my pay cheque. Fast forward to present day and I am a salaried employee as of December 2020 and taxes are still not being taken off of my pay cheque. I never filled out a TD1/T1213 form for either 2020 or 2021 nor have I made any requests since May 2019 for them to continue doing so.

&#x200B;

In 2020 I only worked for them for 5 months out out of the year and didn't even cross the basic personal exemption either, though I will this year for sure and will not have enough student credits to offset taxes owing, meaning that I will have a HUGE tax bill come April 2022. This is fine by me, and I actually welcome it, because I can invest the money in the meantime. I am also OK with having to pay taxes quarterly starting in 2022 since I will likely have to do this anyways in the near future due to capital gains from my investments.

&#x200B;

However, my question is: Do I carry any liability in this? Can I be reprimanded for it?

As far as I'm concerned, this responsibility lies squarely with my employer, again, the Federal Government, and I should have taxes taken off every year until I produce a TD1/T1213 form to advise otherwise. This was my understanding from the onset: If I wanted taxes to be left on my pay cheque I would have to fill out the form each year.",6,1611253147.0,2021,2021-01-21,Taxes,Bubbly_Mongoose,0,l24471

Dividend income advice,"I've read good advice from this community given different scenarios, so thought I'd share mine for suggestions.
I received 30K dividend income from a side project in January 2021 and wondering where would be the best place to put it. 

Additional details:  
Living in Quebec, working in Ontario. Mid-forties. Day job salary $90K. Lots of RSP and TFSA room. Mortgage and HLOC ~$300,000 at 3%. Auto loan $30K at 4%. 

My main concern is that I'm not sure what the tax will be on that $30K as I haven't done this before. I looked at online calculators quickly but didn't feel I got a definitive number. I'd like account for the additional income tax and have considered:  
- prepay QC instalment to offset tax time hit next year  
- contribute to RSP to offset taxes with refund

As this is 2021 income, I guess I should wait until after March deadline if I transfer to RSP so it's more beneficial next year?  
After I understand the numbers from the tax question above, the remainder is the old question of whether to pay down debt or invest. Any thoughts there would be appreciated as well. Thanks!

EDIT - looks like taxes will be about $12K. So, what's my best strategy today to be in the best position next year?  
- Park 12K somewhere like TFSA ETF? Use remaining 18K toward car loan or investments?  
- Put it all into RRSPs? Looks like the RRSP tax savings would then cover the 12K owed if I read the calculator right.",8,1611250627.0,2021,2021-01-21,Taxes,zephuros,2,l23b2t

Down payment from TFSA or Margin acct?,"I’m buying a small investment property and curious if I should be pulling my down payment from my TFSA (currently maxed all invested in stocks) or my cash margin acct (all stock). I believe I should use my TFSA as it would not be subject to taxes whereas selling anything from my margin acct, I’d be on the hook for capital gains. This is my first property purchase (and will not be my primary residence) if that makes any difference.

Girlfriend wants me to invest her LIRA for her with her Questrade. What are some good medium risk options I can buy considering the money is unavailable until retirement?,"Hi everyone,

My girlfriend left her job in the fall to go back to school, and we moved her DC pension plan to a Questrade LIRA account. The account is finally ready to begin investing, and I'm wondering what would be some good medium risk options to purchase? She won't be able to talk out the money until retirement, so no fear of needing it anytime soon. 

I personally only use TD e-series funds for my personal investments and I can do that directly with my bank account. Never used Questrade before. Do they have any type of retirement portfolios I can buy into, or would that only be available through their management services? Is there an all-in-one fund I can buy instead of having to buy bonds & equities likes I do for my e-series?

Thanks for any help!",14,1611249358.0,2021,2021-01-21,Investing,Genticles,0,l22uf5
Advice on investing for my kids,"My dad just gifted my 3 kids (aged 12, 8, and 5) $1000 each and asked me to put it in to their RESPs. However, my wife and I have already secured all the RESP grants (and are on pace to reach the maximum grants for each of them) and we are making regular monthly RESP contributions. When we model it out we believe that their RESPs will have a reasonable amount to support them through post-secondary. I'd rather do something else with the money, still with the idea that it will be there for them when they are young adults, but without the restrictions of an RESP. Of course, I'd also like to invest the money so that it grows in the mean time.

My immediate thought was a GIC but interest rates are so low that it's not worth it. I also thought of opening a TFSA for them and investing in a mutual fund, but quickly learned they have to be 18.

So, what are my best options to invest the $1000 in a way that it will actually grow and be freely available to my kids in 8-12 years?",9,1611249153.0,2021,2021-01-21,Investing,critercat,1,l22rp8
How can I go about obtaining copies of my 2019 and 2018 CRA assessments?,"Hi there, folks. My wife and I are working on purchasing our first home, and as a part of the mortgage process I need to get my hands on my CRA assessments from 2018 and 2019.

Secondly, if I call the CRA, I get an error message saying they're busy and the queues are full, so I can't even wait on hold. I called at 9am sharp this morning and got this message.

So I can't get the info from the site, and they're uncontactable regarding the matter.

🎊 I finally reached my first (XX)k! 🎉,"I want to keep this post short, sweet and straight to the point.

I'm not trying to brag or anything but I just wanted to share my excitement on my financial goal! (I would share with my friends but they don't care much for when it comes to money goals unless its gossip 🙄 lol)

But anyways, I've FINALLY saved over 5k!! (7k to be exact!, this may seem like chump change to most but to me it's a big deal). I could never go past 2k - 3k, I've always found myself dabbling into my savings or helping someone else when they asked for money.

But as a new mom in my early 30s and a single family income I've decided to stop helping others (as selfish as this may sound) and started to do what's best for me and my little one.

I've seriously and actively started saving and getting my shit together since August 2020 and that was the most adult and best decision I've made!

When I recently ran into unexpected expenses it felt SO good to have money for it and not be completely broke after it or having little to no money and having to run back to mommy/daddy for help!

I am looking forward to saving 10k in the next couple months and turning that 10k to 20k and so forth!

Ahhhhh this feels SO great!! For the first time in my 30s I actually feel like such a responsible adult! Hahaa 🎉

Again I'm not trying to brag but I hope this serves as a encouragement for anyone especially strong independent woman in their late 20s to early 30s and single mums that it's not to late to get financially right and you are more then capable of doing it on your own🥰♥️",110,1611248905.0,2021,2021-01-21,,milfncookie88,1323,l22og2
Maternity Leave and option payout,"I'm currently pregnant, and employed full time at a private company. We were given options as part of our compensation package, and there has been a lot of talk in the office about the company going up for sale in the near future. If the company sells while I'm on maternity leave while receiving government payments, and my options vest and payout, would my government payments be clawed back, or completely cancelled?

When I was on my last maternity leave years ago, a received a partial bonus as I worked half the year, and it was paid out during maternity leave. It didn't affect my government benefits then. I'm thinking options are different as they are put under income on a t4 when they're paid out, no?

Advice for paying mortgage vs investing and possible smith maneuver,"Hello, I am a mid 30’s Ontario couple, 2 kids,  both working professionals earning in the $90k’s range and also small time landlords. We live in northern Ontario so house prices are reasonable (cheap) and market rents are good. Meaning landlording essentially pays a small salary with the profit, even factoring in after paying taxes, not just banking on future equity gain.

Started with a triplex (lived in 1 apt) and payed it off in 2 years, with all the double payments, yearly lump payments and payment increases etc. Used equity to move and buy family home on lake, same thing later with all extra payments on family home leftover mortgage payed it off in 4 years. Still mortgage left on rental up for renewal soon at 20yr mark.

I am transitioning to stay at home dad/full time landlord. Travel too much for work and stress on family, Covid etc. Purchased 3 more rental properties within a few months. Wife wants to do same thing again, turn on double mortgage payments and pay extras to essentially drop 25yr mortgage and have all properties payed off in 10 years. The cash flow from properties will allow this. Essentially in the future live off landlord income / retire early etc. 

Is the difference of being debt free early vs invest now for growth that much better? I know most advice is to let the mortgage ride full term and invest...

The other point is our lake house being fully paid off, now with the crazy hot waterfront market has nearly doubled value, should I consider pulling a smith maneuver thing and HELOC to invest to write off the interest? I am just learning about this all recently.

We have been lucky and done very well, but always looking to make the future worry free. We pretty much live modestly, no northern Ontario toys, no snow machines or jet skis or boats or quads or nothing, no huntin or fishin or expensive holidays lol.

Thoughts on permanent/whole life insurance,"I’m nearly 30 and with the birth of my first child thinking it’s finally time to get life insurance

While the majority will be term, at least for now (much cheaper and provides the ‘catastrophe’ insurance im looking for wife and child) I was also considering adding a small permanent life insurance portion (250K or so, paid up over 20 years)

I was wondering how other people thought about this and general thoughts on whole/permanent insurance in general. Unlike term where the initial premiums are fairly flat up until 35 for start of term, permanent life rates go up pretty substantially for each year you wait/age 

While my RRSP and TFSA aren’t maxed yet, I hope they will be in a few years, so understand that permanent life is a decent tax preferred option once those 2 are maxed

Also while the permanent life premiums are much higher I don’t expect to have any issues with paying them over the next 20 years so limited risk of letting it lapse

Also if it is relevant to the advice people give, I currently make about 250K/year and expect/hope that to continue to increase as long as I stay in my current field

Group RRSP Transfer,"The recent post on the front page of this subreddit regarding a high MER Group RRSP had comments which said check if you can transfer out the funds...
Well I checked my group rrsp and it says:


>Withdrawing your regular contributions while
>you’re employed isn’t permitted unless required by
>law. Withdrawals of contributions you made on a
>voluntary basis are permitted at any time



contributions ""made on a voluntary basis"" seem to be anything over my employers match amount, which is very little as I just contribute to this plan for the match... So I guess my question is, is it required by law for them to allow me to withdraw transfer these funds? This is the only relevant section I could find regarding a transfer when reviewing all of the documents I have regarding this plan, I will ask my employer but I assume they will provide me with the details above...


Edit: From further communication today, voluntary contributions = anything I contribute that does not get matched, for example, if they match the first $1000, this would mean that my contributed $1000 and the $1000 the company contributed I can not transfer/withdraw, but if I put another $1000, making my total contributions $2000 and matched $1000, then I would be able to transfer this $1000 'voluntary contribution' out.",12,1611213696.0,2021,2021-01-21,Investing,itsbetterthanWOW2,13,l1thgw

API for Taxes,"Hello everyone!

I am looking for an API to explore my taxes or some preexisting open source code -> a way to programmatically to see what happens when I increase certain parameters. For example what happens when I put X amount of money into RRSP -> how does this reflect in my tax return? I am very familiar with programming, but find it difficult to visualize all the possibilities/considerations in tax returns.

For example, here is pseudocode:

------------------------------------

TaxAPI tax = new TaxAPI()

tax.province = ON

tax.yearlyIncome = 10000

tax.retirementContribution = 100

tax.studentLoanPayment = 1000

tax.healthExpense = 1000

tax.charity = 10

....

(other relevant parameters)

print tax.computeTaxOwingBasedOnParameters()

------------------------------------


I would then iterate over a few parameters I have direct control over ( for example tax.charity or tax.retirementContribution) to optimize tax process and understand what the effect of each entry is. Maybe plot some curves for understanding. Another example is how much money you choose to pay monthly for your student loan ( https://osap.gov.on.ca/AidEstimator2021Web/enterapp/debt_calculator.xhtml ) -> this can influence your tax credit.


Ideally, the API would have a nice way of setting all the relevant to CRA parameters and a relatively accurate calculation process of final tax results.

If there are paid applications that do this for you, I am also interested. I am assuming the application would involve more manual work -> I prefer to program things myself, but don't have the time or expertise to implement things from scratch -> would like to work on a preexisting system.",12,1611209612.0,2021,2021-01-21,Taxes,taxmaxapi,1,l1skg4

Cheapest index fund in Group RRSP has 1.25% MER,"Sun Life. The same exact index fund (TD US) has only 0.33% MER as e-Series. Index ETFs are even cheaper.

1. Does my employer know we are getting ripped off? I actually have doubt in competence of our benefits people.
2. If they do, is it because they are getting kickback from Sun Life?
3. I get the impression that none of our workers care or even know what MER is, which is how the employer keeps getting away with it. When I brought this issue up during a seminar with Sun Life I got blank stares across the board. The initial enrollment form didn't even have MER and they are kept well hidden.

First home buyer for investment property + how to avoid mortgage conditions,"Hi,

My wife and I are both first home buyers and would like to buy an investment property instead of a home to live in. We're renting comfortabley in the area and prefer to keep renting while having an investment property. We're a few hours away from the GTA and think it could be a decent place in the future.

First, can we do it with 5% and only put it under one of our names? I understood that investment properties need to have 20% but wasn't sure if it's only after you already own your own house.  if it is possible to put 5% but the mortgage company demends for it to not be an investment property (according to the conditions on lowest mortgage offers on ratespy) is there any way around that?

Alternatively If that route is not possible, should we buy the same property, finish the basement, move out of our current rental and move to the main floor while having a tenant in the basement? What happens if we want to move out after a year or two and want to insert a renter to the main floor - will we have an issue given that it was not supposed to be an investment property?

We're very novice in this area and would appreciate help on the matter.

Filing my taxes as a sex worker what do I do?,"Hi everyone,

I hope you guys won’t judge me but I really need some advice and I’m shitting my pants right now with sheer anxiety. So I worked as a sex worker independently before covid and I never kept good records. I did the majority of my work through e-transfer and some through cash. I want to make an honest good faith effort to report this but I truly don’t know how. I’ve always had a fear of taxes and I just have never really done them. I was low income before working as a sex worker so I have a bunch of t4’s from previous retail jobs but I am most concerned about this. I do have receipts for rent, therapy and I can probably get my prescription receipts. 

I had to stop working once covid hit and I got cerb. There was no way I could go back to working safely. I ended up getting a part time retail job but it was only 4-14 hours a week.  So I continued getting cerb under the guidelines. 

I want to pay my taxes and have honestly wanted to do it for a long time but I was always afraid even before I started working as a sex worker because it gave me mad anxiety because my mom was always awful during tax time. What do I do here? Am I utterly screwed? Any advice is appreciated and I hope you guys don’t judge, thank you.

Elderly man hassled over bank withdrawal. Is this right?,"Hi there. I'm new to this subreddit as well as reddit in general, so please redirect me if this has already been answered somewhere.

My 84 year old grandfather, who has a thick European accent and speaks in broken (yet understandable) English went to an RBC branch to take out 3K today. The teller wouldn't give it to him unless he told him exactly what he was using the money for. When he made up a reason (he didn't think the teller had the right to know why, but I must specify that it wasn't for anything illegal) he was still denied access to the money. Now, this RBC is in an area that is very judgmental and xenophobic, so my knee-jerk reaction was to assume that he was either denied it due to his accent, English-speaking ability or his age. But before I assume the worst, I want to know the facts. So, is this standard protocol? If not, what should have happened differently?

PSA: The CRA is not going to crack down on your $20k TFSA!,"Really not trying to be snarky but people really seem to be stressed about the CRA coming for their cap gains in their TFSA.

What the CRA *is* looking at is people with for instance $500k accounts. They’re realizing how much tax they gave up by creating these accounts and so are now basically trying to backtrack on hugely successful accounts. 

But bottom line, there is no set limit of # of trades you can do, and day trading is not actually prohibited. 

If you have a PERSONAL (not anecdotal) story of the CRA auditing your small/medium sized account, I’d love to hear it and be proved wrong. But no one commenting on the many many TFSA posts seems to have concrete instances where penalties applied.

Smith Manoeuvre or SM + TFSA,"Hi there, 

Reading more and more on the SM and was wondering if I could poll the group. 

At the moment I can refinance my mortgage and pull out about $160k of equity. New mortgage would be at a rate of 1.92% (this would be the blended rate with Scotia as I am still outside of my renewal window... if I wait to September 2021, the rates could be around 1.62% if nothing changes) and with a HELOC rate 2.95%. At the moment, we (my wife and I) max our RRSPs but we both have substantial TFSA room (I'd say $50k each).

With where the rates are on lending, would it be more beneficial to begin the SM and only keep adding to our TFSAs when we have extra cash flow...

\- or -

would it make sense to split the HELOC (i.e. create two distinct HELOCs for ease of accounting), max our TFSAs with one HELOC (recognizing that we won't be able to deduct the interest) and proceed with the SM with the other HELOC?  

Additional info: My MTR would vary between 43% - 47%. We are quite young and would let all investments grow for several decades.

Switching Banks: A Very Canadian Question,"**RANT (tldr follows):**
I’ve banked with RBC for decades but feel they’re screwing me around. I use many of their products and services and my customer lifetime value to them is substantial. 

My mortgages are coming up for renewal and they won’t come close to matching what HSBC is offering. The agent kept telling me the 1.79% Fixed they offered was “incredible.”

On the other side of the interest coin their HISA and GIC products are a joke so I already moved to EQ Bank. Yay for 2%!

RBC Direct Investing is clumsy, limited in function, and just all round pretty bad. 

The list goes on. With all of that said I do like having all things under one roof. 

**TL;DR**
Does TD or another major bank offer a concierge service to port all products and service to them from another bank?

Will RBC fight for my business if I tell them I’m jumping ship as Bell and Rogers do?",12,1611186662.0,2021,2021-01-20,Banking,incitatus-says,1,l1lwsl

What credit card to get from here?,"Hey guys,

Before my question, a bit about me: I’m 19 and going to a university here in Canada. I love personal finance and at 18 got a credit card with my bank (RBC) I even switched out the one they ore qualified me for that had no rewards and a $20 fee to a rewards card that was free!

I recently made a tangerine bank account so I could get the third category on the money back card but it seems like they didn’t approve me. I’ve never carried a balance and have a had my credit card for over a year and a half and use it a bit every month.

I work part time, income maybe around 16 000, would be higher if I go full time somewhere in the summer.

What card do you guys recommend? Credit karma gives me a credit score of 723. I would like a no fee card because I don’t spend a ton, and would like cash back/rewards",7,1611186466.0,2021,2021-01-20,Credit,DR0516,1,l1luk5

Why doesn't REIT for down payment savings get recommended?,"This isn't really a ""I figured out the magical secret"" but rather just confirming out what I assume to be true. Saving for a down payment with 1-4 year time horizon almost always is recommended to go in a HISA. But why doesn't a REIT make sense?

The upside is your down payment scales with the asset you're going to buy.

The downside is that it may dip. But if it does, so does the asset you're buying.

Sure, a HISA would mean your down payment actually stays steady while RE dips but that's a long shot in today's world with interest rates so low. And if RE dips massively, like 50% or more, I think we'd have much bigger problems on hand anyway.

So I'm curious, what's the analysis on this?",25,1611182457.0,2021,2021-01-20,,BriefAdvancement,0,l1khef

We would also do programs with experts like tax advisors, incorporation experts, people experienced I'm startups and venture capital.

We would be planning interviews when appropriate and other features we feel make the podcast fun, informative and providing value to listeners.

We also intend to do regular surveys and polls for future topics of discussion and episode themes.

I would like everyone's thoughts on this.  Would you listen, would you be a subscriber?  Our target demographic would be listeners under 40.

I'm going to be honest, my spending habits between then and now were far from acceptable but I'm trying to smarten up and build for my future. ***I'm looking to maximize my tax-sheltered investments and looking for portfolio composition advice to maximize utility.***

I got really lucky with my current situation where I live at home with my parents rent-free (at least for the next year or two) and I have little to no expenses apart from miscellaneous stuff like helping out with groceries or entertainment.

It currently has $2k contributed to it and I plan on maxing it out, holding mainly blue chips with a few growth stocks while trading weekly.

rant: lost foreclosure in court today and it went to lower bidder since closing date was 1 week sooner,"RANT here just so disappointed. Sold our condo in December. Have the profit on hand. My parter and I have spent the last month waiting for court on our accepted offer (**$613,000**) on a foreclosure in Victoria BC. This was a brand new development that went into foreclosure during building. No families were displaced. We got notified 2 days before court there was another offer, but because its sealed we had the option to increase our offer without knowing their offer. the neighbouring townhome sold last week in court for **$625,100**. We really wanted it so increased our offer from **$613,000 to $637,300.**

Just got news the competing offer was **$636,800.** We got it right??

Wrong, our closing date was set for 3 weeks after court but their offer was 2 weeks after court meaning they would start paying the bank 1 week earlier than we would and the interest rate worked out to make their bid **$148** more than ours when incorporating this ""lost income"". We were told if its a close call the judge *usually* goes with the initial accepted offer but the complete opposite happened. They incorporated lost income into working out the bid values rather than face value.

basically, wtf. no one told us the potential interest lost by difference in closing date was incorporated into the bid price. we did not require 3 weeks we could pay the downpayment in cash next week. feeling so frustrated and hopeless we won't find anything",18,1611177132.0,2021,2021-01-20,Housing,cheerful_robots,31,l1iojg

Moving from the US to Ontario! (Many questions 😁),"Hello friends!

I’m reaching out for some financial advice as I finalize my move from the states up to Canada!

A little background on the situation: my partner is a dual citizen (Canadian and US) and her family lives in Toronto. We are in our mid-20s and decided we wanted a little change in our lives now that we’re both finished with school. So, we decided to explore obtaining my permanent residence card by way of common law partnership so that we could move up to Canada!

We are still in the process of applying, but plan on moving up to live with her parents at the end of August, when our current lease is up. 

We are both super excited to move up to Canada (or back to Canada, in my partner’s case) and start a new chapter in our lives, but there are quite a number of questions that I have regarding the financial implications of moving to a Canada (and Ontario/Toronto, since I assume that, like states, provinces have separate laws and regulations regarding finances in addition to any federal laws)

I am filing this post under the flare of “Misc.” because the numerous questions I have fall into multiple categories. I will list them down below, and thank you in advance for your help and advice!

Questions:

* Monetarily, all of my assets are in USD. What are the duty/tax implications on bringing these assets (A combination of 401(k), Roth 401(k), Roth IRA, savings, checking, and stocks) into Canada. Also, what are the recommendations around keeping those assets in USD or changing them over to CAD? Being in my mid-20s and having just finished school recently, I don’t have a lot of money to my name. However, it’s enough (≈ 80k USD in total, since I worked during all of my college years at a job with some benefits) and I want to make sure I am protecting my monetary future.

* Besides monetary assets, when it comes to moving my other assets into Ontario, what are the duty/tax implications on those? I have done some research that shows certain things are not taxed, such as necessary household goods and my furniture, etc. but what about when it comes to my other assets? For instance, I’m a musician and have a home studio with equipment/instruments worth about $30,000 USD, an alcohol collection appraised at ≈ $10,000 USD, and a rather humble collection of watches valued at around $15,000 USD (which, in the watch collecting world, is almost nothing, but it’s an incredibly engaging and fun hobby 😂)

* Also, in the same vein as the above question, my partner and I have a car that we would like to take up with us, but are unsure if it meets the Canadian auto standards. As such, what are the duty/tax implications on owning a car that you’re moving with, as well as the cost to get it retrofitted to be considered safe in Ontario (assuming that Ontario may have different rules than, for instance, Quebec or BC)?

* When we do move up, are there any recommendations as to a good bank or financial institution? My partner has an account at BMO through her family and we were considering that. My primary banking institution in the states is actually TD bank, which I am hoping will make my transition of monetary funds a little easier since TD is a Canadian financial institution.

* After we move up, we are lucky to be able to stay with my partner’s parents for a bit while we get settled. There will be a period of time where I will be unable to work while my permanent residency application is processed, so I’m super grateful for them to extend an invitation to stay at their home while we settle. And however, once we do figure out where we may wish to rent, or maybe even buy, Are there any particular recommendations around renting or purchasing in Toronto/GTA?


Apologies for the incredibly long post! 

I really appreciate any help or advice!

Looking for some advice on a specific rent vs buy situation!,"Hi All,

Throwaway account because I'm shy.

My husband and I live in Metro Vancouver. We have been very fortunate to have spent the last couple of years with very cheap rent through a family friend. As a result, we have been able to pay off some of our debts and have begun saving towards a downpayment on our own place.

However, our landlords are looking to purchase a new home, and we have the option of staying in our current location, or moving along with them. If we stayed, we would still have cheap rent (around $750/month). If we go, our rent would still be quite cheap, but would go up  as we would be moving from a 1bed -> 2bed basement suite ($1,200).

Our issue is that we have begun saving aggressively, and were hoping to buy a condo or townhouse out further east mid-to-late next year.

Our total income right now is about $110k per year, and we are saving approximately $4k per month.  We are both in entry-level positions, and we are also starting our own business that we hope will be profitable in the next year or two (sidelined by COVID). Our savings so far equate to about $30k in a HISA TFSA and a $10k emergency fund, with a small employer-match RRSP of only $5k so far. I also have $27k left on my student loans. We were hoping to buy in the sub-500k range and are saving towards a 20% downpayment.

If we stayed, we could save a bit more each month and buy faster. Once we manage to buy, we would be looking at considerably higher payments for our housing (at least $2.5k per month including strata/condo fees, property taxes, and other utilities). With our current savings, I know that we could afford it and still save around $1k per month.

However, if we moved, we would gain a considerably larger and nicer space. In this case and for this much rent, would it be worth it to stay longer, save our downpayment, and invest everything after that? One of the main reasons we are looking to buy is to settle down and gain some housing stability, as we would like to have kids. The 2 bedroom basement suite would allow us to start, and would be cheap enough that taking maternity leave would not be stressful on our finances. In addition to this, we are both in entry level positions and our business is gaining traction, so we expect to be making more money in the next few years, which would likely afford us more flexibility in terms of buying a home. We would not want to stay in this suite forever, as 2 bedrooms will likely get tight as we grow our family. However, I expect we would be fine for a few years.

My main concern are housing prices in Metro Vancouver. I am worried that if we don't bite the bullet now, we could be priced out. If we bought sooner, we might struggle at the beginning, especially if I took maternity leave, but would it be worth it for getting into the market?

So, I guess our two options are:

1. Stay, maintain cheaper rent for the next 18 months, save $4k per month in the HISA for the downpayment. Buy mid-to-late next year.
2. Move, rent goes up a bit, continue saving more slowly, invest the difference, start a family. Buy in 4-5 years.

Any advice?

What to do with downpayment money while waiting for the right house?,"Quick question... This is in addition to my emergency fund and debts paid off.

I have a $40,000 downpayment for a house and am adding more to the pot each month.

* $20,000 in EQ Bank TFSA @ 2.4%
* $9000 in RRSPs( don't want to put in anymore since I will have to pay it back eventually ).
* $1000 in various stocks and cryptos on Wealthsimple.
* $10,000  in Cash account.

How can I organize my down payment money to get the most return and avoid having any long-term commitment incase the right house comes on the market?

Tax Season and Mortgage Deferral?,"I have a relatively specific question, 

We rent out a portion of our house (40% of square footage) and when the pandemic hit and our jobs were affected we chose to defer our mortgage. With tax season approaching I am wondering if we are able to deduct the interest that accrued during the deferral on our mortgage (again I am only talking about 40% of mortgage interest)? Although the interest that accrued was not paid during this calendar year it was all added to the principle mortgage amount.

Taking up passive investing- how's this look?,"35 years old, wife and kid, $55k-ish income plus variable income from spouse, have an employer-backed pension, $10k to put away (opportunity cash from a big one-off contract), 2 month emergency fund (and growing), steadily paying down remaining debt (priority 1, but want to get the ball rolling with investments while I’ve got the cash in a pile). First time ever having a pile of money that wasn’t dedicated to an emergency or fixing broken stuff, so late to the game but better late than never.

These will be our first investments ever, and we’d like to keep it simple. Hold-and-keep discipline won’t be a problem. Overall goals would be to be able to retire ever or at all eventually.

Current plan:

Put together a passive investing portfolio following the Canadian Couch Potato’s model portfolios from 2020. Going with TD e-series so we can easily contribute monthly dollar amounts- the convenience seems worth the higher MER as we’re absolute beginners. Figure we’ll start with the TDB 900, 902, 909 and 911 at 25%, rebalance monthly, and in 5 years consider switching to a 40/60 bonds equity split to get back in line with the rule of thumb about holding your age in bonds. Put it in a TFSA with TD Direct Investing, get fees waived with automatic $100/month deposits (at a minimum: actual may be higher, still looking at what this year will be like).

Any glaring errors, missteps? Monthly rebalance too frequent?",11,1611171503.0,2021,2021-01-20,,thunderchunks,6,l1go5r

New SIN number following Identity Theft? Please help.,"Update: The credit inquiries have slowed down. I am still waiting on a lot of report updates and investigation updates. I contacted so many government agencies and resources and I can say I don't think I can do more. Hoping nothing more comes of this and the thief just gives up using my SIN and ID.  


Hi Everyone, so my main problem right now is that someone stole all my ID's (excluding my birth certificate and passport.) This was a home invasion already filed with the police this past November. They have recently tried using my SIN to apply to nearly a dozen credit agencies and companies for phones, subscriptions, etc in just the last 2 weeks.

I already have fraud alerts on both my Equifax and TransUnion accounts. I also called them and did some online reports on all the inquiries made and to confirm they were aware of the frauds occurring.

The problem is only a handful of these companies on my credit inquiry list actually reached out to confirm my identity (most did not). I individually called everyone and after many hours, was able to get each to identify a fraudulent account was made with my information and have their security and fraud teams investigate it. The only company I had no luck with was Telus, ""we do not have a fraud department.""

My question is, can I get a new SIN number? Am I doomed to be glued to my credit report constantly calling every company that shows up on my inquiry list to tell them to cancel the account being made? Is my credit ruined forever? I have called so many companies and agencies, the cops, and no one has helped me much with this other than to contact the credit boroughs (which is the first thing I did.) I just want to start over, if it means I have to start at 0 credit again so be it. I can't take the constant calling and work missed to deal with credit being taken out under my name. I have been crying for hours constantly telling people to not issue me credit, I haven't applied for anything.

Compounding interest - multiple accounts,"I’ll keep it short and simple. 

When people around here talk about an amount of money they have invested or an amount to have available for retirement and then also discuss how compounding interest helped get them there , I get that but I’m unsure of something. 

How does the fact that in most cases people have this “total amount” spread out over so many different accounts and across partners in life such as a wife or husband. 

For example let’s say in total I have $350k put away for our retirement... but it’s spread out over two RRSP’s and two TFSA’s (my wife and I). 

What is the impact when the majority of this amount is held across our RRSP’s and a portion of this will just end up back in the tax mans pocket when I start to draw down on it ?

The interest earned on 1 of these doesn’t impact the other and so on. 

I don’t want to over complicate this but to me it seems like people describe their nest egg as a single lump sum of money invested somewhere just earning interest.",5,1611170677.0,2021,2021-01-20,Investing,investornewb,2,l1gdf2

How do I value items purchased used for Insurance?,"Hi, I (30, F, BC) am purchasing tenant's insurance for the first time. 

I try to avoid buying things new as much as possible and therefore I'm having trouble calculating value.

As an example, I have a lot of outdoor gear and have two $1000 sleeping bags I purchased used for $300, and $650. These are things that would be very hard or impossible to replace at that cost. 

On the other hand, I paid $650 for my bike used and while new ones are worth much more it'd be easy to find a suitable replacement at that price. Is that treated the same?

I understand this is an estimate but I'm curious how a claim would work out if I had to make one down the line. I have proof of purchase for everything through correspondence with the sellers but no receipts. Would that bite me? 

I have looked this up but everything I've found says add up value and include a formula for depreciation but things don't depreciate as quickly if you bought them secondhand already. 

This might seem like a dumb question but almost all of my possessions were purchased used from my clothing to my furniture to my electronics.

I guess our main concerns are how much does hydro and heat usually cost in a 2BDR condo? Most maintenance fees we have seen in the 500 range do not cover this.

Question about financial advisor having full control over TFSA,"Hi everyone,

I'm new to investments and decided to leverage the services from a personal financial advisor, which are included in the pension plan package I have as part of my workplace benefits.

After a few zoom calls where I shared all my personal financial history and details with them, they came with a set of recommendations in order to achieve my retirement goals. Among these, they suggested a new TFSA account based on mixed investments, which they'd also be in charge of setting up for me.

It was only during the process of going over the online form to open this account that they told me that I wouldn't be able to manage it online as I currently do with the group plan offered by my employer. Instead, everytime I needed to do a lump-sum contribution, withdraw money from it or put the automatic deposits on pause I'd have to request the advisor to do it. I was super taken aback by this lack of control, especially given that everything is done online these days when it comes to managing personal finances.

I'm curious to know from this sub if this indeed sounds odd or if I'm being overly concerned about it. Have you ever gone through this type of experience? Is it common for financial advisors to have full control of a TFSA account instead of their clients?",2,1611160877.0,2021,2021-01-20,Investing,poligonal,1,l1csxy

Making a Luxury purchase when I was raised to save everything... Help please,"I'm currently 28, I make $100k before taxes on salary and have since I was 23.  Living at home for a number of years really helped me build my savings when I got my job.  Growing up, my family drove into me that debt is very bad and to save everything I can for a rainy day.  I'm currently debt free and any extra money I have each month goes into savings/investments.  I've always felt guilty for making even small purchases (<$1000) just because I feel like that money could be saved for my retirement.  I do enjoy a few hobbies like golfing which is where my recreation money goes now.  A few  years ago, I received a large inheritance from a family member and invested it for the future.

With COVID shutdowns in 2020, and I'm assuming it'll be similar for the next year or two still, I'm getting really antsy sitting around home doing nothing.  I've always wanted a wakeboard boat for the summer and I have been looking and pricing them out this winter.  At this point, I'm literally looking at paying cash for one because I can't fathom paying the 6% interest on a toy over a number of years.

My inner battle right now is: Do I spend some of the money I have saved on a toy that I can enjoy for a number of years in my youth (can sell it eventually since they hold value quite well), or do I just continue to save the money?

Any help from people making luxury purchases would be really helpful.  It's not like a car that is absolutely necessary for transportation that I can justify the costs easily.

Tax implications for Incentive Units awarded by a non-Canadian controlled private company,"Here's the situation. Please forgive me if it's not clear; I am happy to clarify anything that's necessary and that I'm legally allowed to.

&#x200B;

1. The company that is awarding me these units is a privately held company based in the United States.
2. I am being awarded ""Incentive Units"", which I believe are similar to RSUs, but structured a bit differently. They are structured as ""profit interest"" so that they are apparently tax-free for me at time of grant. From the Q&A of the contract:""Practically speaking, the Incentive Units are equivalent to a stock option, except for a few differences. Like a stock option in a corporation, an Incentive Unit allows you to share in the increase in the value of the company, over the value of the Company on the date of grant (i.e., the exercise price for a stock option). However, unlike a stock option, you are not required to pay the exercise price to receive ownership in the Company. You are an owner upon grant. The Company is organized as a limited liability company for tax reasons and accordingly cannot issue stock options.""This seems to be predicated on filing an 83(b) Election form for the IRS within 30 days of receipt of the contract, though, but I'm not a US citizen.
3. These units are vested equally over 4 years.
4. These units are, from what I can gather, effectively illiquid. The contract specifies that I cannot sell the units back to the company or to another person without prior written consent from the company, which they can unilaterally refuse.

I have read that for RSUs, the entire value of vested RSUs must be included as ordinary income in the year of vesting. This seems… wrong, for non-public companies? If I can't sell them, how can they be considered income?

For example, if I am awarded 40,000 units, and it vests over 4 years, that's 10,000 units/year. Say each unit is ""worth"" $10 (incentive liquidation value divided by total number of units created), that would mean that each year I need to add $100,000 to my personal income, and thus pay income tax on that at whatever marginal rate I exist in at the time.

Given that I can't just sell these units whenever I want, that seems a bit extreme - they're effectively worthless because there's no market for them.

I know that the answer to most of this will be ""talk to a tax lawyer"", which I am also doing. It turns out cross-border tax lawyers are incredibly expensive, too, and this will likely cost me $10,000 to have them simply review the 5-page contract and tell me what my tax obligations are. And I'm just trying to gather as much information as possible so that

Additional Questions: does anything change if I have the incentive units contract modified to award the units to my corporation (Inc), which I am president of and draw a salary from?

**EDIT**: I say RSU in the above, but it seems like the incentive units are more like stock options for a privately held company instead of an RSU.",12,1611158146.0,2021,2021-01-20,,canada_money_talks,2,l1bwc3

Wife lost her job. Suggestions for next steps?,"My wife and I are in our 30's. We were on track to buy out our 2BDR condo from our landlord until COVID hit. Our landlord has been nothing but fantastic in refunding us our December rent and not increasing our rent amount. We currently pay 2000$/mo for a unit worth about 750k.

Our plan was to buy out the condo this year but my wife lost her job in September. It is a very specialized field and English is not her first language. This pandemic directly affected her business and very likely will not recover. In fact her original plan was to only work in Toronto for a few years and go back home to Asia but the business took off here so she stayed and has been here for 9 years.

We currently have 190k in savings and my single income of 3500$/mo. With the housing prices continuing to rise and no future savings in sight do we continue to rent and possibly invest in re-education for my wife? or take everything we have now and force ourselves into a 500k condo somewhere in the GTA. Moving away from the GTA or specifically North York area is going to make future work for my wife much more difficult due to language issues.",8,1611157454.0,2021,2021-01-20,,Affectionate-Cow-398,2,l1bo5m

2. If Yes, and her home title is to the extent of 50% can she only get 50% of refund?
3. How is the refund obtained, paid in full and then refunded? Or do we withhold the refund amount and pay the balance?
4. Since the rule states spouse cannot own a home to apply for this refund, is the definition of spouse both ways? Since i am not eligible (due to owning a home outside Canada) she wouldn't be eligible as well, because though she does not own a home her spouse (i.e. me) owns a home?

Topping up defined benefit pension or contribute to group rsp? Or both?,"Hi all,

Need some advice on retirement planning through my company. They offer a DB plan(first time experiencing this) where I don't need to contribute anything but have the option to top up 4% above the ympe. The company will contribute 'as necessary' (not sure what that means...)

And/ or I can contribute to the group rsp at 4% and company will match 50% of that.

Facts:
1. I'm in my late 20s, in GTA 
2. Large international company
3. Looking to stay at this company long term, maybe even till I retire, I started in 2020
4. My total income is about 100-110k and will stay around this level for a few years so I need to buy rrsp anyways if I don't do it through the group option, but I also know that the pension uses my rrsp room.
5. Tfsa is maxed
6. Have never contributed to my rrsp since my income has been lower in previous years 

Question is, should I top up my db? Does anyone have experience in that and think it's worth it? Or contribute to my group rsp where they match? Even though their matching is a taxable benefit. Or both...? 

Even if I do 4% for each option, I should generate enough room each year but I don't want to contribute more than I have/need to. 

Since this is my first time with a db option, I'm not sure what's the best thing to do or what questions I should be asking. Any type of thoughts would be helpful.

How can I recover from unwise RRSP use?,"I have made some unwise decisions about my RRSP and I'm not sure where to go from here. I am 36 years old, so I have approximately 30 years until I retire.

I started contributing to my RRSP when I had a minimum wage job in high school. My income was so low I probably wasn't paying taxes anyway. I withdrew from my RRSP when I was in my early 20s because I decided to go back to school and was a broke student.

I bought a house in 2014 and used around $3k for the home buyer's plan. I filled out the tax forms incorrectly to pay it back, and my RRSP contributions have been credited as a normal deposit instead of repayment of the HBP. I only realized this last year.

My spouse is a stay at home parent and we do not plan on them re-entering the workforce as our kids grow older. When we retire, I will have my DBPP and CPP, but my spouse will only have savings from TFSA and RRSP. I withdrew some of my RRSP money and in order for my spouse to put it into a spousal RRSP.

My current situation is this: I have around $2k in my RRSP. My spouse has around $8k in their spousal RRSP. My HBP loan will be paid off entirely after we file our taxes in the spring. I have been paying into a DBPP for 7 years.

I have lost a lot of contribution room due to poor decisions. I never worried about that before, because I figured we could never possibly hope to max out RRSP contributions anyway. Now I worry about how much that is going to hurt us in the future.

Does anybody have any advice for me? Should we be focusing on TFSA, my RRSP, or spousal RRSP? My income for 2020 was $111k. I anticipate my 2021 pay will be between $100-110k.

Trading Platforms for Canadians?,"Is there a trading platform for Canadians, something like Robinhood?

I tried WeslthSimple and had a thoroughly unpleasant experience. First, after setting up your account, it takes three business days to transfer funds to the WealthSimple account. That was a minor inconvenience, but whatever. Transferred $100 just to try the app out. While waiting for my funds to transfer I checked out their analytics. They're terrible. There's no way to check movement throughout the day, except for a live price number, no graph. Also, that live price number is 15 minutes behind the actual market. Not what I want for day trading, but I can work with it. There's other analytics out there.

The big kick in the teeth. My money finally cleared, so I bought shares in AMC at 8:40am EST on January 19th. Watches it soar over 30% in a day. I felt like one of those WSB guys thinking about all the rocketship emojis and ""TO THE MOON!"" gains. Then I get a notification from WeslthSimple at 4:04pm saying my order was cancelled. I'm guessing this happened because the price changed. Of course it did, it's been over SEVEN HOURS!

I can tolerate waiting 3 days for my money to clear. I can tolerate analytics that are uninformative and 15 minutes behind. What I can't tolerate is a seven hour and twenty-five minute delay in purchasing.

I wound up with WealthSimple because from my research they were the only platform available to Canadians that doesn't require a minimum balance or charge an exorbitant fee on every trade negating any gains on my meager investments. My experience thus far has shown me that WealthSimple is broken. Unless there's an alternative, I may be best to stay out of the market until I have more money to play with or another platform becomes available in Canada.

Here are a few highlights:

* The CPI rose 0.7% in 2020 on an average annual basis, following an increase of 1.9% in 2019. The CPI’s 2020 increase was the slowest since the economic downturn of 2009.

Need a gut check,"My husband and I just purchased our 'forever' home. This is our second time purchasing a home together. I'm having that familiar anxious feeling about spending (what feels like) all our money and wouldn't mind a sounding board that everything is going to be OK and would also like some advice about a 25 vs 30 year mortgage.

Some stats:

With a 25 year amortization, our mortgage payments will be about 30% of our take-home monthly pay. If one of us lost our jobs, it would be about 40-45% of our take-home monthly pay. We've left ourselves a safety net of cash that is about 6 month's salary. If we went with a 30 year amortization, our mortgage would be about 25% of our take-home monthly pay.

We're debating going with a 30 year amortization with the intention that we would still pay it off faster but would have the advantage of more available cash if needed in the future. We're planning to have some additional expenses in the next few years (from starting a family), and my husband is also considering starting his own business in the next few years (not 100% yet). 

Does anyone else have experience with 25 or 30 year mortgages? I'm quite conservative with money and we like to pay down debts quickly but am wanting some perspective about having additional cash every month now and being able to make lump payments later, especially with our future family plans. 

Any thoughts or perspective is much appreciated. 

Thanks and have a great day!",22,1611147632.0,2021,2021-01-20,,Br3itn3r,1,l18pq2
"""hidden"" benefit of defined benefits pension","I believe a huge ""hidden"" benefit of DB pensions is that it enables their owners/beneficiaries to take on much riskier positions with more profit potential. 

For example, I'm in my early 20s and have a decent (federal) government job (pays between 60k to 80k) with a defined benefits (DB) pension. Because I have a DB pension I basically have a financial asset that is very safe and is guaranteed profit.

I also have self managed investments in TFSA. Allocation is approx. 90% stocks (index funds) and 10% stock options (in the money call options on index funds with 120+ days to expiry). This is a relatively high risk portfolio, but even if the options go to zero, and the stocks tank like 30%, its not a big deal because my DB pension is the majority of my financial assets.

This benefit is also augmented by the financial stability of the jobs that have DB pension (government job). I don't believe in cash emergency fund because I will always have employment income. Having a bunch of cash tied up in cash represents a guaranteed loss to due inflation and lost investing opportunity. Instead, I use low interest line of credit, margin loan and HELOC for emergency fund, which means I can have more money in assets.

RRSP withdrawals and how much I'll receive/owe in my case. Please advise.,"I can't for the life of me wrap my head around how much I'll be taxed in this situation. Even googling calculators doesn't help. I am really rrsp ignorant/'blind'.

\* I have \~$56k in my RRSP which is the max I can have on top of a DB pension plan. I'm still saving, but I can only put in $1000/yr to max it out

\* I want to withdraw all of it at once to buy a place in the future.

\* I make approx \~$85k, top of my pay scale, unlikely to increase much every year (I'm a teacher, so on paper my district if they print me a letter of confirmation, it says I earn $92k/year but my union's payscale says it's more like $85k. I guess this is due to the district calculating as if I was full time with limited vacation and what I have is because I don't get paid over vacations. And **I guess for tax purposes it's the \~85k that counts or whatever is reported at the end of my tax return - which line is needed for these tax purposes? - and not what my school board says in a letter?**)

So to calculate how much of the $56k or future amount I will actually keep, I keep reading this:

\> *Any withdrawals from your RRSP are immediately subject to withholding tax. If you withdraw up to $5,000, the withholding tax rate is 10%. If you withdraw between $5,001 and $15,000, the withholding tax rate is 20%. If you withdraw more than $15,000, the withholding tax rate rises to 30%*

So basically I have budgeted that I will actually have in my possession if I cashed it out 70% of what I have in my account ($39200 or however much more in the future)

**But isn't there an extra part where the amount in my RRSP counts as income so it looks like I will earn \~$85k PLUS whatever amount I take out of the RRSP? And how does that get taxed?**

So I actually need to budget for having 70% of the RRSP amount PLUS some amount I'll owe for taxes that year? **How much would that be, approximately,** if I basically don't owe or receive any taxes back each year? (single, one public job, no kids or tax benefits, simple case, no car or private work)

I may be overthinking this. but if someone could break it down using my specific numbers (albeit approximations) I would REALLY appreciate it.

Smith Maneuver and capitalizing the interest,"Like many others I'm considering jumping into the Smith Maneuver but one aspect I'm not entirely confident about is using the HELOC to pay for its own interest and then claiming interest on this interest as part of the SM tax deduction.

Can anyone confirm that using a HELOC to pay for its own interest then claiming a deduction for interest on this interest is in fact acceptable to the CRA (assuming it's used for income-generating investments in a non-registered account)?

Renting out my primary residence while relocating and renting in another province,"Hello! I've been looking through old threads, landlord/tenancy agreements, and Gov of Canada tax forms and I've become a bit confused at best practices.

Background: I live in SK and own a condo board managed apartment. I have a new job in AB that will need me to relocate by the end of the year, since I've never lived out of province I thought it would make sense to rent out my place out for a year or more while I figure out the new job/housing situation in the city I'm moving to. 

Questions:

* In order to avoid capital gains tax on the property when I sell in a few years, is there a way to keep it as a primary residence while residing in AB?  For mail, mortgage statements, and income tax, my residence may have to be the apartment I'm renting, does that affect anything?
* For keeping records, should I open a new chequing account for rental income to be deposited in? Should that account also be the one condo fees, property tax and mortgages are drawn from?
* What is the best way to keep solid records ?
* Is there any benefit to renting a partially furnished apartment vs a completely empty one?
* Will it be possible to have an accountant in AB manage the tax information for my property in SK or should I also have a Sk accountant?

Selling Mutual funds dilemma and switching to ETF (21-year-old),"Hello, I am 21 years old and am facing a dilemma. I currently have around 80k in mutual funds at my bank.

 ( [Dynamic Power American Growth Fund Series F](https://funds.dynamic.ca/fundprofiles/en-US/PW2K/F/CAD/PDF) ). 

The dynamic fund has done well but the other one has been just okay for a 21-year-old. I have a long time frame and think I should be a bit more growth-orientated. I have about 59k in the balanced growth and the balance in the dynamic fund. 

I have recently started on Questrade investing in ETF's my main holdings are VFV, QQC, XIT, and VUN. So far in 2021, I am outperforming my mutual funds by about 1.5% overall. 

My main question is do you think I should sell both mutual funds, or just the one seeing as the dynamic fund Is performing well but has a high MER of 4.25%. Please advise me on what you would do. I also attached the links for each fund so you can check it out.

Is it worth paying the capital gains that I will face, so that I pay less fees? Do you think I will miss out on better returns if I sell the dynamic power?

If I fund an RESP with TD Direct Investing using the 'bill payment' option from my bank. Will it automatically apply for the CESG?,"I've called TD Direct Investing, but I was on hold for ages, so I thought I would ask here before I try calling again tomorrow.

Making a move-out cash agreement with our landlord who's written unfair expenses into our lease -- how to protect our tenant right to pursue remuneration with BC Tenancy Branch in case he tries to get us to sign them away in the move-out?,"So this is a little complex, I'll try to be as brief as I can.

My roommate and I rent a basement suite in Vancouver Metro area. Our landlord has been trying to sell this house since June, which has included having his real estate agent walk 60+ people through our suite, something we've allowed to help encourage the sale.

An offer just fell through after the buyers decided the inspection revealed too much costly repair, and our landlord is now planning on removing the house from the market for a while before re-listing it, and has offered us an amount of money to vacate by March 1.

Not to sound prejudicial or cliche here, but our landlord is essentially a slumlord. He's a weasel. I served him for a rodent problem and he sent a repair person to wall up the underside of the kitchen sink, which covers about 1/50th of exposed wall - something the repair person agreed was inadequate.

He also tried to include property care in our lease without giving us exclusive use of the property - basically making the poor people renting downstairs mow and weed for two separate households, in spite of a lot of back and forth on the unfairness of that.

**The most financially significant thing for us has to do with the utilities**. The upstairs tenants hightailed it last March, and the utilities were under their name. Landlord put in the lease and insisted in multiple emails that it was the tenants' job to take on the utilities under our name, and so of course I have a BC Hydro and Fortis bill that now runs under my account...**along with dings to my record and a deposit on file because the upstairs tenants, gasp, left it in arrears.**

[There has been a situationally similar decision finding this practice unconscionable](https://tenants.bc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/RTB-Utilities-for-multi-unit-house-in-tenants-name-is-unconscionable.pdf) (a legal term, not a major condemnation)  but it is a matter of record and it has been found that including it in the lease is not good practice. In essence, we're been paying an additional 1/2 of what we should be paying, regardless of whether the upstairs is tenanted or not. **I would like that 1/2 back.** It's not a massive amount of money, but I'm not a fan of throwing cash to the wind.

Now -- the only thing I really plan to pursue after we're moved, which is our most important endgame, and I know it'll take plenty of time and due process for it to even be addressed in the system.

**My concern is that the landlord will attempt to slide an item into our move-out compensation agreement to try and force us not to seek further remuneration on this issue**\*\*\*.\*\*\*

He might try. That's the kind of person he is, he's extremely dishonest not just as a landlord but as a business person, to a quite startling degree. Think ""using graphics programs to change client data"" dishonest. He also tried to order us off the property at the end of the lease, on January 31st, and I'm still not sure if he thought that was a legal option he had, or if he just wanted to see if we were stupid enough not to understand how BC leases work. It's a toss-up.

I have serious doubts about the legality of the enforceability of such wording in general, but I wanted to see if anyone with insight into BC law, or even access to a pro-bono legal resource, could help us assess this.

If it turns out that it's totally unenforceable per the BC Tenancy Act, ie: those rights supersede any casual cash arrangement for a non-eviction move out, then he can put whatever he wants in there and it doesn't make a difference to me.  If a contract including such wording requires legal approval, or notarization he'll probably not bother including it. But I'd rather have a little more info going in, because this has been an abusive relationship from the word go, and we really want to protect our interests. I may decide it's not worth the trouble to fight it, just to get us out of here, but at least I'll have done some due diligence.

Canada’s income gap is growing as the recovery of the labour market plays out very differently from past recessions: high-wage jobs appear to be thriving in the pandemic.

Over the past year, there has been a net increase of nearly 350,000 people employed in the top half of wages, making at least $27.82 an hour, CIBC Capital Markets said Tuesday in a report. And job creation is clustering near the top: Around 260,000 positions have been added in the highest wage quartile of at least $41.73 an hour. At the other end, there’s been a net loss of 740,000 employees in the bottom half of hourly wages, an outcome more typical of recessions.

To pay off student debt or new mortgage? Advice requested.,"Myself (23F) and my partner (24M) just bought our first house in Eastern Ontario (5 year variable, 1.7%). We each have about $35k in TFSAs, and he has $13k in an RRSP. I have ~$75k in savings, I will be using most of it ($58k) for our downpayment. 

We just recently finished paying off my partner’s student line of credit ($40k), but I still have a national student loan of $27k. I am a graduate student who is graduating in April, at which point I will be allowed to start making repayments. 

Our combined paycheques will be sufficient to cover our $1000/month mortgage and living expenses without touching our TFSA’s, but we’re wondering if taking money out of our TFSAs to either 1) pay off my national student loan immediately or 2) pay 15% of our mortgage principle immediately would be wise. 

As first time mortgage-owners, we don’t know if it makes sense to pay off aggressively or instead enjoy the low monthly payments and invest our money somewhere other than just a TFSA? We have heard about ETFs but need to do more research about that type of investment. 

Any insight or suggestions are welcome, thankyou!!",17,1611104339.0,2021,2021-01-19,Debt,not_a_bot_probably,5,l0xy2l

I'm using Turbo Tax as it allows 'non-resident' unlike Simple Tax which I used before, is this the best for this purpose? I also declare income and expenses for a property in the UK.

Am I better off just notifying the CRA and not doing a return (website says you don't need to do unless you owe taxes or want a refund), or at what point is it worth hiring an accountant ie. could I make a very costly mistake doing this myself.

"Questions about Canadian+US taxes, bona fide residency, and COVID","Hi everyone, having missed the [cross-border AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/l0la5s/ama_cross_border_canus_taxation_10am4pm_est/) this morning because of work, I am wondering if someone (maybe u/ro_otbear or u/FelixYYZ, if they are still have any free time after their generous session this morning) has any experience or insight into my cross-border case, somewhat complicated already but more so with COVID.

**Perhaps the shortest way to ask the relevant question, before I go into unnecessary details and without the COVID element: if I (an American) was indefinitely in Canada (renewing temporary annual contracts) for a few years, but I started actively seeking a job (either in the US or Canada) and then did accept (sometime during 2020) a US job that starts in 2021, am I disqualified from bona fide residency when filing US taxes for 2020?**

The reality is slightly even more complicated: I was in Canada for a few years, while my wife stayed in the US. I received an offer in Canada and one in the US, and ended up choosing the US one, but negotiated for it to start only in 2021, with the intention to stay in Canada through the year.

Then COVID happened, and after trying to waiting it out, finally I went to work remotely for a month or two (I thought) from the US, to be with my wife (she was not allowed to cross the border to Canada). I was in the US from May to July, September to October, and late November and on. The remaining time I was in Canada. I continued to (virtually) work at my Canadian job through the end of 2020, and I maintained my apartment in Canada until the start of December (at the time I returned to the US in November, I brought most of my things; I had thought I might come back to Canada once more before my contract was up, but this did not end up happening).

I am wondering what my status in the US and Canada is for this tax cycle. Will I qualify for the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion or bona fide residency (considering the [updated rules](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/covid-19-relief-for-form-2555-filers))? Or will I have to double-pay taxes? And I am not sure if this question makes sense, but is there any “good” order to file my taxes in? Lastly, I am considering getting a cross-border tax accountant --- does anyone have any recommendations or experience with a firm and wouldn't mind sharing how much they paid in the past, and is it really easier than filing the taxes on my own?

Landlord keep threatening to hike rent,"I live in a complex of low rise buildings with 18 apartments in Ontario. The landlord put steel pins and blue boxes in a shed behind the building so that we put garbage in. Every two weeks, someone collects the garbage and puts on curb side for collection.

A tenant does not follow best practices, and does not close steel pins after he puts garbage in, or does not put them in the pins and just throws them anywhere in the shed. 

The landlord posted notes that this is inappropriate, and that rats would come and infest the shed and move to the building. He threatens to install a camera surveillance system to catch the person who does this and charge him with cleaning bills. 

Up till here, no issues. The thing is he threatens to ask the tenant board for an ‘above the guidelines increase’ on our rent to cover the cost of surveilling us. He cites costs of $ 15000
+ ongoing maintenance. 

How can I make sure I am informed when he applies for such nonsense? How can I resist this and what are my rights here? In the contract, he has the right of surveillance of the property, but costs on me?!

"32(M) in middle of separation – Need opinions on whether to sell & split house revenue, or buy partner out and keep house. Details in post. Is a bit long. Sorry :/","As mentioned… 32M in talks with wife to separate. Overall a fairly amicable process for us so far. No resentment, things just aren’t working out. Covid has made us realize we aren’t happy together. No kids yet, so we have decided to move on but want to remain on good terms as our family and friend circles are very intertwined.
Both have maintained our jobs and worked from home through Covid. Both have maxed TFSA’s. I am in unique situation because I am employed by an American company and make USD, therefore I also have a healthy 401k due to company match and my focus on investing. Wife pays into a pension plan since she is in healthcare and therefore does not have an RRSP, she is a great saver though. I have a smaller, fairly insignificant amount in an RRSP.

We live in Southwestern Ontario, and co-own a house which we paid $260k for back in 2016. We could now sell the house for between $450k and $500k due to renovations we have done and overall market increase in our area which has been happening the last 6 years. I believe Covid will continue to accelerate it once we get out of this mess as we are in a nice suburb.

I am trying to decide whether to sell and rent, or buy my wife out at an agreed upon price if possible. 
I have done calculations but would appreciate advice..

If we assume 50/50 split (which in our case we have verbally agreed to), and then me paying her a bit extra for me to keep certain things already in the house like the couch.. kitchen table, etc.. Say agreed price is 500k (using high value)..Subtract the 160k left on mortgage… That brings us to 340.. divided by 2 is 170.. plus 10k to her for misc items.. Lets say I pay her out $180k, and the bank lets me (assumption) take full ownership and tack that on to my existing mortgage. Now I have a 340k mortgage. 5 year fixed is up this June anyways, so.. remortgage at same time.

I won’t get into all details.. but I have calculated that all mandatory monthly living expenses including the mortgage at 1.95% fixed for 5 years as an assumption to be $3150 (mortgage being $1315 of that).. Including even down to monthly groceries, gas, etc… Again, total worst case. Assuming rent is $1500 a month.. Comparable living expenses renting would be approx. $2800. I could cover my costs both ways using the 50/30/20 rule.. but it is a bit tighter with the house (not assuming I rent out to a friend). 

The big difference is that if I buy out our place I take on a considerable amount more debt, and do not put any more money into investments… If I rent.. I could take revenue, approx $150k, top up my RRSP, add the rest to a Non-Registered acct and let it grow and compound in long hold ETF’s. 

Now here’s the issue. Renting in my city is garbage. Hard to come by and not ideal. Our house is a 1250sqft raised ranch in a gorgeous area that is expected to continue to grow, and now is almost completely re-done. I did all the work myself. If I choose to buyout and things allow for it, I would certainly rent to a friend for $500 a month or so for extra income as well.

I just can’t get over 2 things though… 1) If we sold and I invested that money it would be able to grow and compound heavily but then I wouldn’t have any home equity and could miss out on future house growth post pandemic 2) I am afraid if I sell, then I will be forced to buy in at an even higher cost (and possibly higher interest rate) later.

Any advice? :/",16,1611096369.0,2021,2021-01-19,Housing,howoldisfifteenrealy,2,l0vcoo
Rate of Return on a RESP,"Hello

I am trying to get a better understanding of how the RESP account works. I am a newb when it comes to investing but would like to invest in my sons future education. I have been watching some YouTube videos but am still  curious on some aspects. Mainly the rate of return and interest  at which it grows. I was fascinated that by the time my son is 18 he could have close to $86 000 in the RESP considering I contribute the maximum amount of $2500 a year. I was hoping someone can reassure me that I have understood this correctly:

Assuming I make the maximum $2,500 a month, by age 18 I would have contributed $42,500 and recieved the maximum $7,200 in government grant. This would mean I have a total of $49,700. However, I am curious on the interest earned along the way. What is the interest rate ideally for this type of account? Is it compound interest and what is the compound frequency? Using the number from the video $86,000 - 49,700 = $36,300 of money earned from interest? Is this correct because it seems hard for me to believe that it could earn that much just sitting there.",24,1611096294.0,2021,2021-01-19,,Don_k1ng,3,l0vbt2

What are the signs that an apartment building is being transformed into condos?,"Hi everyone! The nature of my question comes from the renovations that are happening in my apartment building.

RBC Banking Account Age of Majority? [ONTARIO],"Hey everyone, 

I am a student in high school looking to create a banking account; I am completely new to personal finance. I'm just kind of confused because the RBC website says that the account I would like to open is ""For students 13 years or older"" (which I am), but when I try to apply for it, it says I must be the age of majority in my province (which I am not). Is there any particular reason for this? 

Have a great day,

Need some direction,"So I am really new to this because of my own willful ignorance, and I want to change.   


Recently, my wife and I have become (mostly)(consumer) debt free for the first time in our marriage (Huzzah!). We have been terrible with our finances in the past. Now we have 4 months of expenses saved up, and are ready to really learn about investing. We have some extra money set aside ($20K from a lump sum we received) and I'm not sure what to do with it. We have been following Dave Ramsey to get out of debt, but I know that some of the investing stuff is different in the US. 

I feel like I need a good financial planner, but have no clue who to trust. I feel I wouldn't know a good one from a bad one. Any recommendations of good places for a complete beginner to start learning?  


Here's what I am thinking so far. Put $6000 into my TFSA (that's the max right? What happens if I do more?) 

An RSP would be next I think. With my income, I should be able to put the rest into that. 

What about investing into mutual funds or something along that line? 

A wrench to consider> We own our current home and have a rental. We are fine to sell the rental if that's smart. The renal has a mortgage of 64,000 left. Rent is 1200/mo, and the mortgage and fees are just under $1000(\~$700/$300). Currently stable renter.  Would it be better to put the $20 on the mortgage? Is there a limit to how much you can pay in a year extra? (planning to call my bank about this). This would probably cut the mortgage down from 7 years to 5 or less I think. Then, having freed up income with the property, we could invest that income. 

So is the compound interest from investing into RSP better than the results from paying our rental mortgage? How would I even begin to calculate this?

I'd love some thoughts, opinions, and recommendations for financial planners in the Edmonton area. 

Thank you in advance!",15,1611090997.0,2021,2021-01-19,,jtjmorris,1,l0tgvh

Thoughts on RRSP vs TFSA for an immigrant,"I immigrated here about 6 years ago and have just recently been in the position to start contributing to registered savings accounts. I’ve currently got a TFSA with both Questrade and WS trade with various stocks and ETFs.

My question is around RRSP’s - I feel like I should start making use of the contribution room. But I’m also not 100% certain that I will stay here long term i.e into retirement. And considering the hefty withholding taxes I would have to pay if I did decide withdraw to move back to my home country in say, 10-15 years. Is it worth contributing to it or shouldn’t stick with TFSA’s for now?

Basically I’m not sure that the tax deductible benefit is worth what I might have to pay down the line if I withdraw.

Transitioning TFSA into something safer for first house,"I am thinking of possibly buying my first house this year, and would like to transition my portfolio into something a bit safer.  I am somewhat young (29) and was willing to take on some risk by entering the market when it crashed last spring. I decided to dump most of my savings into my TFSA.  I first added to my portfolio in late-April and added a couple times along the way (as recent as this ATD.B dip last week). 

I have been thinking of buying my first home for some time, but never had a timeline in mind.  The past couple of weeks, I've started to come to the conclusion that I would like to possibly purchase a home this year.  I'm not in a rush as I am paying low rent (600/mo, utilities included), but I am starting to need the privacy and extra space.  I am just starting to contact brokers/realtors now.

My TFSA portfolio currently sits at about 10% cash, is now up approximately 20% since April... and I plan on using these funds as my 20% down-payment on a house.  I think it would be wise to transition into something safer (although I am still okay to take on some risks). 

  
I don't really know what to do with my funds from here.

* Is it more wise to put stop losses on my stocks/funds and transition slowly over time... or just move everything now?
* Should I move my funds to bonds or HISAs?  Any recommendations, HISAs seem like a row return these days... I've looked at something like [HYI.TO](https://HYI.TO) (6% yield bond) or [CSD.TO](https://CSD.TO) (5% yield)... are these risky?  
* Would something like 50% VGRO and 50% in some HISA be silly?  Or just transitioning my stocks into HISA and keep my ETFs?
* Is it worthwhile transitioning some of my TFSA portfolio to my RRSP to get the 35K benefit? If I were to take advantage of this, is recontributing to the RRSP also tax free?

If it helps, my currently portfolio is:

CASH - 10.5%  
[AC.TO](https://AC.TO) \- 10%  
[AQN.TO](https://AQN.TO) \- 2.5%

T2200 - Employer not signing declaration despite imposed WFH,"Hi PFC,

I recently learned that my employer will not be signing the T2200 Declaration for Conditions of Employment for any employee who had an assigned seat in our office. 

Since March I have not been able to work in the office and I have had to convert my second bedroom to accommodate a home set-up. Which I think is deserving of deductions in excess of the measly $400 with the flat rate method.

Has anyone else experienced this? Do I have grounds to push for my employer to sign the T2200? I feel that their policy not to sign declarations for non-telecommuter employees is borne from laziness as there is no other cost to the employer.

I'm working on a little project and was just wondering if anyone here knows of FinTech companies who offer savings accounts. The 3 that I currently am aware of are:

1. Neo Financial - Offering a 1.55% Interest account.
2. KOHO - Offering a 1.2% Interest account
3. Wealthsimple - Offering a .75% Interest account 

I basically am just defining a savings account as an account where you can sit your money and earn .25%+ interest annually. Companies like STACK are not included because they do not offer interest based returns in any of their accounts. I define FinTech as basically anything other than a Schedule 1 bank (so EQ Bank is not a FinTech IMO).

Investment condo in Winnipeg,"

My spouse and I are considering purchasing an investment condo in Winnipeg. I was lucky this past year and have Tesla shares currently worth around 100k USD in my TFSA. I am a TSLA bull, but believe it would be smart to diversify by cashing out 1/3 of my investment. 


We are both 28 y/o and both have very stable government jobs, I am currently in an entry level position and make ~40k she makes ~90k. Ideally within 5 years I will be making a base salary of approximate 100k and she will be making 100k in 3 years. 


We currently own a condo with 300k left on the mortgage. The monthly carrying costs are around 1900/month. We have a basement suite we rent on AIRBNB and have consistently been making 1800+ a month after fees and management, we expect to be higher once covid restrictions are lifted. 


We have been pre-approved with a broker for a 200k MTG, we are looking at purchasing a condo in the Exchange which is close to the forks, parks, and the MTS centre.  The expected carrying costs for the condo we're looking at would be around $1300


We expect to be able to rent it on AIRBNB and net $1600 to $3500 per month as it is in a popular tourist spot.


Does this seem reasonable. am I missing something?

I have a RRSP / checking / line of credit with tangerine their MER fee's were 1.07% i believe. 
I also have a crypto account with wealthsimple trade. Their invest app the MER looks to be 0.70%.
Would it be smarter for me to pull my TFSA out of CIBC and put it in tangerine or wealthsimple, keeping in mind that I might need to pull money out at any point for a big purchase, or repair.

RESP Contribution Above Grant Max vs. Unregistered Account,"My current plan is to contribute $2,500/year/child to maximize the 20% Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG) until I hit the $36k contribution/$7,200 grant point and then stop contributions.

Now I'm looking ahead a few years wondering if, in a scenario where I've maximized our registered accounts, it's worthwhile to contribute the extra 14k per child beyond that point. If I understand correctly, there are yearly maximum withdrawals (not including the initial contributions which I can take back without tax implications) from the account by the child while they're enrolled in the school, and while it will be taxable, it will be taxed based on my child's yearly income which likely will not be any more than the RESP withdrawal anyway (effectively 0-20% while they're in school).

Assuming I will be giving the same amount to my kids regardless (to take out the ""who has control of the money"" consideration), without the 20% grant incentive, is it possible that an RESP contribution above 36k is a better place to put my money rather than an unregistered account?

Buying a Car off the Lease: What are the ways the dealer could try to screw me over and how do I avoid them?,"Hello PFC,

My car's lease will be up in May and I intend to buy it. I have absolutely no faith in the dealer. Long story short: some functions were not working in the car when we first bought it and they have demonstrated complete incompetence and negligence in resolving them. Honestly, I just want to use HELOC to get the car, hand them a cheque and gtfo there as soon as possible.

I fully expect them to screw me over if they can and I've never bought a car off the lease so I would appreciate any comments regarding what is the best way to go about this and hear your experiences.

Can Anyone Explain How an ETF like the ZSP Works?,"Hi!

So I've been tracking the ZSP, which is BMO's S&P 500 ETF. As of writing this, the S&P gained 0.48% today while the ZSP has lost 0.25% today. Other ETFs tracking the S&P, specifically those in USD (the ZSP is in CAD) have gained roughly 0.48%, including the ZSP-U which is just the ZSP ETF in USD. I understand that the reason why the ZSP hasn't gained as much is because the CAD/USD rate has also gone up today (up 0.16% as of writing this). However, shouldn't the gains from the 0.48% increase in the S&P be enough to offset this? Can anyone explain why the ZSP is down so much despite a good day for the S&P?

"Looking to become self-incorporated, but might relocated to the states later in the year. What would happen to my company?","Hello all, noob question here.

I'm looking to become federally incorporated for a small online business. But there is also a pretty high chance that I will be relocating to the states around May / June. What happens to my company once I relocate? I would ideally like to continue, but not sure if I need dissolve my company in Canada and set up a business in the US.

My understanding is that

* to operate in Canada, my company requires a Canadian address
* I should be physically present at the Canadian address for work
* once I relocate to the US, I cannot be present at the Canadian address
* thus, I will have to dissolve my corporation upon leaving for the states
* if I want to continue my business, I would need to get incorporated in the states and start a US business

"PSA : if you've ever had a federal student loan, check your credit report","I got a credit monitoring email this morning telling me that my credit score had gone down considerably, checked my report and a CIBC student loan that I'd paid off in 2012 suddenly reappeared and was listed as ""bad debt /  collections"". It was reported this month, with a date of last activity in 2017. This made no sense since again I'd paid it in full in 2012 and hadn't given it another thought.

&#x200B;

I was able to get through to CIBC just now and apparently what happened is that at some point because of COVID, the federal government did some sort of ""reset"" on student loans, and added interest to every federal student loan that was in their system, including ones like mine that were paid off years ago. This activated files that were long inactive, which triggered fresh credit reporting and, in my case at least, since it was so old it looked like I was extremely overdue. 

&#x200B;

If I didn't have credit monitoring, I wouldn't have noticed this until the next time my credit got pulled, which in my case will be a few months from now when I renew my mortgage! Corrections on a credit report can take 30 days or so, so not noticing something like this until the last minute could have cost me some points on my mortgage interest rate. Just passing it on because according to the woman at CIBC, she's been getting all kinds of calls about it but there are for sure people out there who don't realize yet that this has happened.",29,1611073033.0,2021,2021-01-19,,torquetorque,165,l0n13o

Where to hold 1+ years of money for short-term?,"I recently graduated from a Masters degree, and have $40,000 in a savings account from maxing out student loans in case I can't find a job. I'm slowly starting to look for work as I wrap up projects, but I intend to keep that $40k as an emergency fund in case my spouse and I absolutely cannot find any work in the next year —  IMO unlikely, but who knows, right? The $40k should last me at least a year, likely up to two as we do have some small amounts of income coming in and have plans to adjust our monthly budget at certain trigger points.

I do have other long-term investments (TD eSeries couch potato TFSA + RRSP), and I play with stocks in QuestTrade with some other money, so this is really more of an emergency fund — i.e. I don't want a high risk on this if the economy tanks.

I'm wondering where I should store this. I have it all in a TD Savings account right now that will start charging fees soon since I'm not a student anymore, and offers basically no interest. I also have a Tangerine savings account that my credit card cashback goes into. 

I'm also ok with opening another account as long as I don't have to physically go into a branch right now to open it. I'm currently in Alberta, but plan on leaving (likely within Canada) once the pandemic ends.

Does anyone else feel like quality of life is rapidly deteriorating for younger generations?,"The difference in quality of life from my father to me is astronomical, from just a generation ago. From my view, quality of life has rapidly changed for the worse in just 1-2 generations. With all this happening in such a short timeframe, all sorts of red flags and alarm bells should be going off. There's no end in site and **at this rate** (which appears to be accelerating), it's unimaginable how much worse it'll be in another 1-2 generations.

EDIT:

Wow, a number of people seem to think that just because we have the internet, it makes up for all the other shitty things we face. Well, I'm a coder (and HUGE lover of tech), yet I would trade internet/phones/tech for a MUCH easier chance at life (i.e. better economic environment and MUCH easier upward mobility). Tech absolutely pales in comparison. I imagine most of the people trying to make this argument are older and out of touch.

Here are some of the examples of the shittiness we are facing (shoutout to u/TC1851 for some of these points, they resonated with me): A few decades ago you can graduate high school and support a family working 40 hours a week on one income. Getting a job was easy as fuck. At 65 you could retire with a full pension.

A college degree ACTUALLY meant something. Now it's basically the new high school. **Credential inflation** refers to the devaluation of educational or academic credentials over time and a corresponding decrease in the expected advantage given a degree holder in the job market.

In addition, while the **value** of a degree has been getting watered down, the **cost** of university/college tuition has been rising much faster than inflation. Same with housing. Housing has become a huge issue now. Housing used to be affordable and traffic was low as infrastructure caught up. Before you say it's just Vancouver and Toronto with unaffordable housing, look at recent threads showing that this ""housing unaffordability virus"" is creeping to more surrounding cities year after year. Making locals from those cities face the same unaffordability. So when does that end? Clearly this is sustainable.

Both parents need to work. You don't get a pension anymore. Employment is much more precarious and trying to get a job these days is INSANELY competitive. 100+ job applications MINIMUM.  But oh yeah, smart phones and the internet totally make up for it /s.",1187,1611071681.0,2021,2021-01-19,,heyitsbutters,1932,l0mkdv

Employer is giving me a monthly car allowance. Need to purchase a car. Should I lease for tax purposes?,"I'm in sales. My company is beginning to slowly remove their fleet vehicles from the roads and are replacing them by giving their employees a monthly car allowance of $625.00 a month. This allowance will be evenly distributed and added on top of my bi weekly payment. Keep in mind this $625.00 is already taxed on my pays so i will not actually be seeing that full amount a month. I am also provided with a company gas card that compensates all gas, personal and business.

What are my options here? I'm not interested in maxing out the payment (Though i might not have a choice) and getting as fancy a car as possible. If anything id love to bank some money here. How can i best benefit from tax write-offs? The $625.00 needs to cover both the car payment as well as my insurance (≈$100 a month). I would ideally save an additional $75 - $100.00 a month to build a repair fund.

I understand that if i lease a vehicle, i can not only claim my business mileage and gas, but also the business portion of the lease payment (If I drove 20k, but 15k was for business, i can claim 75% of my lease payment). Is leasing the best option here?

AMA - Cross Border (Can-US) Taxation 10am-4pm EST,"This AMA for Cross border questions will be conduced by u/ro_otbear and assisted/moderated with u/FelixYYZ

u/ro_otbear: I am a cross-border personal expatriate tax accountant and has over 13 years of personal expatriation tax experience, specializing in Canadian and U.S. personal taxation. I have hosted two prior AMA chats on this topic as I noticed that there was a gap in knowledge in the cross-border taxation space within the PFC subreddit, which with my experience, I would be glad to fill. I am here today to discuss, to the best of my ability, any questions that you may have in regards to cross-border expatriation taxation. 

[u/FelixYYZ](https://www.reddit.com/user/FelixYYZ) : I am an expatriate myself and have experience in dealing with cross-borer issues for about a dozen years as an employee and self-employed contractor. I have suffered through audits with the IRS and CRA and have worked with accountants and tax lawyers over the years to learn and absorb all the nuances of US tax issues. I would be glad to discuss these experiences with you today as well as any personal taxation questions that arise. 

Ask us anything related to cross-border expatriation taxation. 

Examples: Canadian related cross-border questions: 

1) What is Canadian residency and how does it impact me? 

2) What is Canadian departure tax? 

3) I am a resident of Canada but work in the US, how does that impact me? 

4) How do foreign tax credits work in my situation? 5) How is my Canadian tax residency impacted with Covid19? 

U.S. related cross-border questions: 

1) As a US citizen working in Canada, what does that mean? 

2) As a US citizen who hasn't filed US returns before, what should I do? 

3) Can I open TFSA/RESP accounts? 

4) What is PFIC? 

5) Is RRSP income taxable at the state level even though it is exempt from US federal taxation under the tax treaty? 

While we can answer general questions about the above, it's always best to provide your personal situation for us to tailor the response to your situation. Depending on the complexity of your situation, we may state that a further discussion is warranted as further research may be required. 

Please note that any taxation advice we provide here are not legally binding and should only be used as a guide. While we do have plenty of experience in this field, each individual’s situation will differ slightly and therefore, you should consult with a cross border tax accountant to confirm your tax position. Please refrain from asking questions related to cross-border corporate taxation as this is outside the realm of our expertise. We look forward to answering as many of your questions as possible. We will be answering questions intermittently between 10am to 4pm.

To not clutter the AMA and to ensure we can answer everyone's query, please do not ask for cross border accountants referrals in the comments section. Feel free to send us a DM instead.",219,1611067815.0,2021,2021-01-19,,AutoModerator,40,l0la5s

Determining Residency Status - Studying Abroad,"Hello r/PersonalFinanceCanada!

*Background*

I am a Canadian Ph.D. student (paying tuition in Canada only). Due to circumstances surrounding COVID-19, I recently moved to Denmark (October 2020) to continue my studies as a 'visiting researcher' for 2 years. Therefore, I am not technically affiliated with the university in Denmark, and I only pay tuition to my institution in Canada. 

*Details*

* I am not paid by anyone in Denmark. My only income is from scholarships in Canada (non-taxable income) as well as teaching in Canada (virtually; taxable income). 
* I have a work and residence permit for my time in Denmark.
* I do not have any primary residential ties in Canada (i.e. property or a spouse)
* I have many secondary residential ties in Canada (i.e. income, drivers license, passport, furniture, etc.)
* I plan to return to Canada following my studies in Denmark

*Question*

* **For tax purposes, what is my residential status in Canada?** Am I considered a factual resident since I am 'studying abroad'? Am I a deemed non-resident? Am I a deemed resident? I am finding it very hard to sift through the jargon on the CRA website, and feel that I may be a special scenario.

Please let me know if any additional information is required to assess my situation! Thank you in advance for any insights.

TLDR: I am a Canadian Ph.D. student paying tuition to a Canadian university but studying in Denmark for 2 years as a visiting researcher. What is my residential status?",6,1611048728.0,2021,2021-01-19,Taxes,HalfJapToTheMax,4,l0gi5q

Starting a joint account // Questions,"Hey everyone,  


The girlfriend and I are starting to move things along and have decided to get a joint bank account to pay for most shared expenses. I've got a handful of questions I'd love some advice and/or info.  


1. How do you do a joint account with your S/O? All money in the shared account? Partial deposits? Do you keep some of your own money as your own?
2. Best chequing account out there? I currently bank with TD and have all my investments with them, would rather stay there, but I will not pay for a checking account.
3. Best credit card out there? We each make around 60-65,000 (incase there are requirements). Would prefer not using one that has an annual fee, unless it has great returns.",7,1611041874.0,2021,2021-01-19,,AngryJawa,3,l0f0ys
Should I buy my first condo now or wait to buy my parents' condo at cost?,"Hi everyone,

So here's my situation. I am currently trying to buy my first property in the Greater Toronto Area. I am looking for a condo (1+1 with two bathrooms), preferably around 700 square feet. I've been saving up all my money to buy this property ever since I started working full-time around 3 years ago. I currently have a total of $145k saved, which was possible since I've been saving up by living with my parents my whole life, and with my girlfriend last year. 

For specifics, I make a base salary of $56k a year plus commission since I work in sales. I made around 94k last year (base + commission). When I approved for a pre-approval for a mortgage, the bank said that they could give me a principal amount of $445 000 with a 1.86% interest rate (giving me the option to look for a property that costs around $550k). This is assuming that I put a downpayment of $100 000 (I wanted to put down more but they advised to only do 100k given the closing costs and lawyer fees, etc). 

I've finally started condo hunting last week, and found a property that I like. It's a 1+1 and 2 bathrooms, and on the 6th floor. I really like how it looks, despite the fact that the view is just of another building and doesn't get a lot of sunshine (not a huge deal to me honestly, but can affect the re-sale value). It is listed for $535k, but the presentation date is this Friday, so there will likely be a bidding war on it. 

I told my parents that I am really considering putting an offer down since I like the property. 

They then suggest that I buy their pre-construction condo that will finally be ready by May of 2022 next year (construction was delayed due to covid and such). The benefit of this is that they are willing to sell it to me at the same cost they bought it for around 2-3 years ago ($600k) and the property has apparently already gone up in value of about $100k despite not being fully built yet. It is a 2 bedroom and 2 bathroom, and has a square footage of around 700. I have seen the floor plan, but never in person or any models since it has not been built yet. It is also on the 22nd floor so the view won't be of just another condo building in front of it. 

My question is, should I still try and take advantage of the condo market and interest rates in the Greater Toronto Area condo market right now? Or should I wait and buy my parents' condo off them at cost?

The benefits of buying my own condo now would be that I can finally move out this year and live on my own and finally invest my money that I've been saving in a property that I will also be living in. After living away from home last year for the first time with my girlfriend, it has made me appreciate living alone (her parents own a condo and they let us live there rent-free last year before selling it this year). I've been saving my money to invest in real estate for years. The con of this is that it will take longer for it to appreciate in value if I am buying it now. I will also be putting a lot more money towards this property since I am buying it off someone rather than at cost from my parents. 

The benefits of waiting until my parents' condo is built is that it has already gone up in value, so as soon as I have it in my possession there is already a return on investment. By the time it's finally built by May 2022, I can only imagine it will continue to go up in value. It will also likely be bigger than any condo that I buy any time soon since it is a two-bedroom. The con of this is that I have to keep living at home for another year and a half (at least, who knows if there are gonna be more delays) and I will be 29 in November and feel like I have been living at home long enough. 

So should I take advantage of the condo market now and buy one ASAP on my own? Or should I buy my parents' pre-construction condo that will be ready May 2022?",7,1611040833.0,2021,2021-01-19,,Iron_Prodigy,0,l0ery4

What to do with a cashed out pension?,"So I’m about to have a small pension I earned while working construction when I was younger. It’s a union pension with what I think is around 15k.

I’ve yet to get the paper work so I’m not sure what % I would lose on this. As it’s not a large sum of money I assume I could do something better with the money for the long term. Currently my fiancé has 85k in student loans that we pay down $3k/mo on it. In the new year I deposited $6600 into a Tfsa for the first time ever.

Chucking money into a dividend ETF like VDY,"Hello,  


I'm hoping this wonderful subreddit can help me out with this. I've learned that if one were to have no source of income other than dividends, then $50,000 worth of dividends in a single year cannot be taxed? Is this correct?  


If this were the case, what's stopping someone from chucking in $1m just into VDY? Being that VDY has approximately a 5% yield, one could gain $50,000 a year in untaxed income without working. Anything wrong with this method?

Contributing to Spouse's person RRSL vs Spousal RRSP,"Hi PFC,

Hoping for some advice. Via Questrade, I made approximately 9000 dollars of contribution to my spouse's personal RRSP for the 2021 tax year. Her recent tax slip, however, names her as having made the contributions although the funds very clearly came from my (non-joint) bank account.

Because she makes significantly less income than I do (25 vs 47% marginal tax rate), I wanted to contribute to her spousal RRSP so that I could get the deduction. I did not realize that a Spousal RRSP is an entirely different account, and I ended up to contributing to her personal RRSP.

Questrade tells me this is not fixable and that unfortunately from their perspective, she is the one who made these contributions. 100% of the value of her RRSP account has been contributed by me.

Is there a way that I can still deduct the contributions from my income, given there is a clear trail of movement of funds from my bank account into her personal RRSP?

Question about rules when investing in stocks within a TFSA," 

I'm very new to investing and opened up a a mutual fund account in my TFSA with RBC at the start of December. I've had the TFSA for years but I don't think I ever got it higher than a maybe 2 or 3 thousand back in like 2012/2013.

I also just opened a TFSA in Wealthsimple Trade because I didn't really have much going on all last year and figure I should maybe try to put that money I made to work. I've gotten started on the app and bought some stock but I've been reading that if you make too many trades you can get in trouble with the CRA as they might consider you a day trader.

I've deposited 4000 CAD and made 17 purchases (6 in December 11 in January)I've made 1 sell trade.I basically deposited 1000 a week and invested it during the week for a month.

I wasn't really sure what I was doing at the start and bought a lot of the same stocks (I have 6 different ones) but I was scared to commit so I made a few small purchases at a time until I felt more comfortable.

One of the stocks I bought has climbed a lot last week and might go up even higher this week. Last week when the stock was starting to rise I bought one share then saw the stock go crazy high and sold what I had because I saw it skyrocket and then plummet. But then it climbed again and I panicked and bought back in at a loss hoping it might keep going up which it now seems like it might.

Will selling this stock again to get out of it for good get me in trouble?

Trying to decide between a bank mortgage or a mortgage company! What is better? Help!,"So I am a first-time buyer and am trying to decide between two brokers, one is with a bank and the other works for an independent mortgage company:

1- the bank broker: said we could get a guaranteed rate of 1.74 but can't go lower unless of course the rate itself goes lower by the time we buy a house; we would also get a pre-approval which I hear is heavily favored when bidding on houses

2- the independent broker: said they can't guarantee us a rate until we close on a house (is that true!?) so not knowing is making me paranoid the rate may be higher then 1.74 (from the bank). They gave us what seems like a pre-approval but isn't because they said the interest rate will change once we close. e.g., the interest rate they gave us was 2.5% which seems really high but they assured me it would change once we close- why and how? 

Overall I am confused why I can't get a concrete rate from this independent broker but am worried if I go with the bank I may miss on a much lower interest rate. What is the best option or best approach to take???",21,1611017403.0,2021,2021-01-18,,claymation05,3,l087vp

Thoughts on Foreclosure purchase,"Currently living in a HCOL area and we've found a foreclosure condo that could potentially allow us to buy a place that fits our family (at least for the next 10 years) in an area that would probably be out of reach normally and should hopefully have a good ROI when we sell in the future to up size (no one can predict the future so who knows if that's the case but historically prices in this area are ~20% more, foreclosure and COVID aside).

For a multitude of reasons (good area, high ROI, 1 child already attending school in the catchment, another 1 will be joining in a few years) we want to stay in this area but we're concerned about the foreclosure process, what are people's thoughts? Are we crazy?

The size of place we need to fit our family is probably out of reach so it's this option, wait and see if prices come down more (with the vaccine coming, who knows), buy a smaller place we can afford and have to move again much sooner than we'd like or move entirely (which is our last option).",9,1611015023.0,2021,2021-01-18,,M_D_E_C_P,11,l07hi3

"Per First Time Home Buyer rules: ""your total borrowing is no more than 4 times your qualifying income"".... doesn't make sense, did example calculation","https://www.placetocallhome.ca/fthbi/first-time-homebuyer-incentive

So let's say:

salary: 85k

house price: 500k

15% down from buyer: 75k

5% from government: 25k

so borrowing is $400k loan, which is more than 4 times the salary of 85k.... (85k * 4 = 340k is the max mortgage that can be taken)

Is this right? I don't understand how someone can use this incentive usefully. If someone has a 85k income, their max purchase price can only be $340k/80% = $425,000.

Asking for Advice: Buying Parents Rental and Mortgage w/ Improvements,"About three years ago, her parents purchased a 2nd house with the intent of one day we would purchase it from them. Since day 1 we've been covering all the expenses (mortgage, taxes, etc.), renovated the backyard, and put minor cosmetic upgrades into the house.

With interest rates where they're at, income/jobs steady, and student debts much lower, now seems like the best time to purchase the home. 

The only problem is that we technically have nothing saved for a down payment, yet there's about $25k in principle payments on the existing mortgage on the house.

Two questions I have is:

1. If we've put ~$25k of payments on the mortgage, could the parents sell the house for what it's worth and gift us the money for the down payment?


2. If we get the highest mortgage the bank could give us (i.e. 2x the cost of the mortgage according to multiple calculators), could we put 50% of the mortgage into renovations? Or is there rules against how much can be applied to renovations?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

Best Way to Manage Debt from US and Canada,"I grew up in the US and have accrued student loan debt, along with debt from 3 credit cards. I moved to Canada and have two more credit cards here. I'm finding that paying off my debt is harder than it needs to be. I've been sending roughly $1k CAD to the US every month to pay debt there, but it feels like it's not doing much. It amounts to less than $800 and I have close to $200 in interest each month, and I can't even send this much some months. Sometimes I'll send too much over, which leads me to not being able to pay enough of my Canadian credit card to avoid the overage fee when interests puts it past the limit. I don't know what my options are and from who to seek help (bank, financial advisor, etc.). My details are below:

* US Card 1: $6,200 (limit is $7,650) @ 21.99%
* US Card 2: $2,570 @ 15.90%
* US Card 3: $1,730 (limit is $1,800) @ 15.90%
* US Student Loan: $6,890 ($4,680 @ 3.4% and $2,210 @ 6.8%)
* CA Card 1: $5,900 (limit is $6,000) @ 19.99%
* CA Card 2: $450 (limit is $500) @ 19.99%
* US debt is in USD and CA debt is in CAD.

All federal student loan debt is in forbearance due to COVID-19, so I haven't been putting money toward that since March.

Over the past year, I've paid about $700USD/mo and $350CAD/mo on debt, on average.

My initial thoughts are to consolidate my debt so I'm only putting money towards a Canadian loan, because the US dollar is killing me. Is that the best option? Is there a way I can consolidate Canadian and American debt? Or perhaps get a Canadian loan and just use it to pay off my US debt? (I imagine I should leave the student loan as-is, due to the low interest rates).

Student with high credit card debt!,"Hi all,
So I currently have a credit card with a $9000 debt attached to it, and a 19.99% interest rate. I’m also a student, and I’ll likely be a student for the foreseeable future (finishing my undergrad and going into law school). So my income is quite low (I sometimes take side jobs working on campus or pet time gigs in offices but not lately due to COVID), and I use my federal and provincial student grants and loans to survive and pay for school. The credit card debt was accrued mostly due to poor financial decisions and FOMO purchases when I was 19/20/21. 
I got the credit card from RBC when I was 19 and was pre-approved for $3500 CL. When I hit that limit, the bank upped it to $6500, and then a third time to $10000. (I have to say that I think it’s quite predatory that RBC let a 19/20 year old student be approved for a $10000 CL, as now I feel like they own my soul).

Anyways, I’ve been making the minimum payment consistently, and put $1000 down every time I get my grants (every four months). The interest makes it impossible to actually put a dent in this debt, so I’ve had the same debt for three years now. 

Recently, I’ve been thinking about a balance transfer to a card with lower interest. Initially I thought about one of the extremely low interest BT cards with a limited period, but I know I can’t pay the whole debt back in 6-9 months yet, so instead I’ve been looking at cards with 10-13% interest rates in order to make the debt a little more manageable. Eventually, when I can work full time I will transfer to a BT credit card and aim to pay it all off in the time period offered. 

Is this a good plan? Is the RBC RateAdvantage card a good one to transfer my balance to in the interim? Since I have such a high CL now, and would unlikely be approved for as much again, will I even be able to transfer the balance over? How does transferring between credit cards from the same bank work? Different banks?

How do I take advantage of a drop in the market if I'm maxed in TFSA?,"Hi, I'm a bit new to this. Just had a thought from a book I've been reading. A drop in the market is generally when people want to buy since it's on a ""discount"" , correct? If so, how would I take advantage of this situation if I were Maxed out in a TFSA. 

I'm not maxed right now, but if I were Maxed out in my TFSA (all used up with stocks), how would I buy more stocks at the ""discount"" price when the market drops? I wouldn't be able to put more in since it's maxed out (at least without tax penalties) and selling my current stocks would be counter productive.

Oh also, I'm 100% Stocks/ETFs since I'm young and don't think I will include bonds for another couple years. Thus, I wouldn't be able to sell bonds to purchase more stocks/ETFs.

"Canadian resident working as a US employee, but WFH in Canada, how to file taxes?","Hi there,

I'm a Canadian working on a TN visa for a company in the US. However, I got the job during COVID, so I've been working remotely from home in Canada for the entire time.

I am being paid on US payroll and being deducted US payroll taxes, FICA, social security, etc. My company does have a Canadian entity, but if I were to be paid through them it would result in salary localization that would literally reduce my compensation by 50%, so I'm not going to do that.

In addition to my direct salary, I have also contributed to the companies 401K and received 401K match. I have unvested RSU's, and also participate in the companies stock purchase program (I have not actually received any shares from this yet, though).

My question is, what is the appropriate way to file my taxes? I seem to be finding two conflicting pieces of advice. Which, if any, of these are correct for my situation?

1. File 1040NR in the US. Report your US income on your Canadian tax return and report all the US taxes you paid as a foreign tax credit to offset the Canadian taxes owed.
2. File 1040NR along with form 8833 in the US and state due to a tax treaty I am exempt from all US taxes. Receive a complete tax refund from the IRS. Report my US income on my Canadian tax return but do not claim any foreign tax credit and offset the Canadian taxes owed using my refund from the IRS.

It seems to me like the net effect of these two options is the same. Does it really matter? For simplicity it seems like I'd prefer the first option if I could.

Additionally, am I able to claim my 401k contributions on my RRSP? Is there anything I need to do with my unvested equity?",10,1611001728.0,2021,2021-01-18,,thrwaway345423424QQ,3,l0312y
Are there any sources to help pay for my wisdom teeth removal?,"Hi all, 

Sorry wasn't sure what flag to set this as. 

So my wisdom teeth have gotten really bad as of last year and since October I've been seeing a dentist about this. 

I FINALLY had my consultation with the surgeon today and - HOLY FUCK the quote is insane!!! Not sure if it's normal but they are quoting me $2800 for all four teeth. 

I do have insurance but this place requires you to pay up front and I don't have $2800 sitting around and we don't have that amount available on our credit card. 

I've been looking around to see if there are any government programs that might help cover the cost at first and we don't have family that would be able to give us that much to cover it. 

Right now it's either waiting a couple years (as I know I won't be able to afford that all this year) or deplete my RRSP (I just opened one so I don't have a ton in there). 

Are there any sources I can maybe look at to help cover the upfront cost?

EDIT: seems that some people are a little confused. We can't use a credit card to pay for this as our credit card doesn't have enough on it to cover this.

Questrade backdated 2020 RRSP contribution to 2019 (just noticed).,"Last night I got a notice from Questrade that I had a tax slip available. I logged into my account and immediately noticed that my 2020 RRSP contribution was much lower than it should have been.

Buyer and Seller - Same Agent for both,"Hi, I came across an interesting situation and wanted to get people's opinions on it. 

I was driving through the neighbourhood and noticed a ""For Sale"" sign on an interesting property. Immediately I recognized him as my parent's real estate agent. I ran it by my parents and they think it wouldn't be a terrible idea to have him represent me as well as the seller.  

As a buyer, the biggest downside to having the same agent as the seller is that you don't really know how much you should pay for the property (as they may be withholding information from you) and you don't have an agent working solely for you to negotiate on your behalf. But here in the GTA, we're very much in a seller's market. If the house is in a great location, and it's built recently or had many recent updates, the interest for it will be very high, competition among buyers will be fierce, and you can expect a lot of offers (or bully offers) within the first hour.

That being said, what kind of bargaining power are we realistically expecting? Are we really giving up much by not having our own agent negotiate on our behalf? Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than they have to, but I've built somewhat of a good intuition on pricing after visiting countless properties last year, and I know the most I am willing to pay. 

In this scenerio, would it be better to have the seller's agent (who is very close to my parents) represent us so that the agent is more inclined to work with us and at the very least let us know where our offer stands? I know this might be edging toward a breach in conduct by revealing too much - but that's on the agent. I don't feel like we are giving up too much with this arrangement.

Tuition Tax credit for online masters in an oversees university,"Hi everyone, I have been trying to get through to the CRA to ask this query for the last week but they are so busy.

I am doing an online masters with a UK university on a part time basis since last September. I am little confused on whether I can claim the fees for a tuition tax credit as I believe the rules are different depending on whether the university is in Canada or oversees.  On the CRA website it has two different forms called T11A and T11D. One one form according to the summary you have to be a full time student but on the other form it doesnt say anything. The reason I am confused is that on the CRA page it mentions you have to be a full time students to claim CRA credits but then I know part time students can claim them also I am just not sure for universities outside of Canada.

International Taxes as a Student - Deemed Residency & RRSP Lifelong Learning Plan,"Hi PFC, so I have a bit of a potentially complex tax situation that I’m trying to understand how it may affect my ability to use the Lifelong Learning Plan to support my studies. I’ve been accepted to a master’s degree in Europe that starts in September 2021, I have savings for school that I’m debating whether I should put into an RRSP to get the tax benefit, and then access them through the LLP.

I see that [you must be a resident of Canada to access the LLP](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/rrsps-related-plans/lifelong-learning-plan/who-participate/conditions-resident-canada.html), I think that it’s likely I would be a deemed resident of Canada while studying abroad, since I will be on education leave from my Canadian employer, and I will maintain most of my finances in Canada, and keep my furniture and a mailing address (via my parents address). The hiccup is that my program takes place in 4 different countries, and I move each semester. I will have a 2-year Belgian student visa since the “host/main” university is in Belgium. In 2022 (when I would access the LLP), I will be living in Belgium (finish semester at end of January), Austria (March-July) and Denmark (September-December). I will be receiving a monthly stipend from a EU-funded scholarship, so I will have income in each of these countries, and from what I can see, all of the countries require registered students to file taxes.

Does anyone know how to square all of these rules with our process for being a deemed resident of Canada?  If I am deemed a resident of another country, does that disqualify me from accessing my RRSP funds, would their be any way around this?

Need some help on the best way to leave an old Investors Group account,"Friends,

Late 30s in Vancouver BC

When I was in my mid 20s, I was looking to save. I had no idea what I was doing, and a ""friend"" who was in Investors Group happily got me to sign up for 50K investment loan and start an IG account with them. It's been sitting 12 years while I've done other things (have a good nest egg saved up, have basically ignored IG) and I've barely touched my IG account, other than paying the loan minimum.

This year I'm finally going to do something with it.

**Loan** (to pay back) - 50k  
**RSP** - ~28k  
**Unregistered** - ~108k  


I have room inside my RRSPs to take the full amount of the remaining money after paying off my loan. I also have a lot of accrued room in my TFSAs. My plan is to:

1. Transfer the RSP to Wealthsimple managed
2. Pay off the 50k loan with proceeds from the unregistered investments
3. Throw the rest of the unregistered money into an RRSP

I know I'll take a tax hit from selling my unregistered investments, is there a better plan than the one I've laid out? Am I missing anything?",1,1610996483.0,2021,2021-01-18,Retirement,cdn-youngdumb,2,l01682

TFSA Contributions w/ spouss,"Over a year ago, my fiance and I purchased a house and have lived together ever since. My understanding is that, from a tax perspective (not a legal perspective), we are considered common-law.

Through work, I have about:

-$27K in company stock (non registered) 

-$50K in index funds (non registered)

I have about 20K contribution room in my TFSA and my finance has about 70K.

I was planning on dumping most of the company stock and then transferring the balance to my TFSA. I understand I will incur capital gains tax as a result of this.  

Here's what I'm wondering:

1) Is it better to sell 20K of the stock now and transfer the balance to my TFSA and buy index ETFs vs. letting it sit there or doing it gradually?

2) Can I do the same thing with the 50K and my fiance's account? I.e., I sell the 50K and deposit it in our shared bank account and then she contributes it to her TFSA?

What's the smartest approach here?

EDIT: We moved in together in Sept 2019. Not sure how relevant this is, but I believe this means we are considered common law from a tax perspective for 2021+.

Is it always best to accept Credit Limit increases (Total Equity Plans),"We bank with Scotia they have something called a [STEP](https://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/personal/mortgages/scotia-total-equity-plan-step.html) where our Mortgage and credit line are tied together.  Our mortgage is now 20% of the total value of our home and the Credit Line has $0 balance and very high borrowing limit $250K, it was originally used to bridge our mortgage but we just kept it since it's such a low interest rate. We also have another Credit Line with 0 balance and 50K Limit not included in the STEP and credit cards (Visa, MC, Amex) all $0 balance and ranging from $5,000 - $10,000 limit.

Scotia is now offering to increase our Credit Line limit another $70K. We are trying to decide if it is a good idea or not to take the increase they are offering?

Pro side:

* Having available cash saved us in the past, we bought a vacation place for $70,000 which was $25,000 below asking because we were able to walk in pre-approved and the buyers had 2 previous bids fall through for financing.
* We may want to buy an investment property. Would having the ability to access $300K help us in bidding or doing repairs etc.?

Cons: 

* Risk of over spending, my wife and I are very fiscally responsible there is little danger that we would go on a Mercedes Benz shopping spree.
* Risk of fraud, this is the one that scares me the most if someone were to steal our identity we have so much available credit it's scary.

Pro or Con

* Risk of harming our Credit score? This is one where, I don't know if it is it better for our Credit score to have more available credit or is it harmful. Keep in mind our future goal might be to buy investment properties.",10,1610991026.0,2021,2021-01-18,Credit,CasperTFG_808,5,kzz8xt
RRSP and TFSA maxed out. Should I keep savings in my business or personal?,"Hi there,

I've worked as a freelance web developer for the past ten years and managed to have a fairly fruitful career because of it. I've been fortunate to be in a position where I've maxed out my TFSA and RRSP and now I'm unsure of how to proceed forward. 

I use my corporation to help control my income so that I don't move into a higher tax bracket.

1. Lower fees.
2. WS/QT have marketed themselves well and have given me the impression that they’re better than your average “investment guy” and might be more in-the-know when choosing which stocks to buy into until i can start making more informed decisions.

I'm curious - what's in it for the bank to sell mortgages below inflation rate ?,"I'm sure when it boils down to it there are multiple complex factors at play but i'd be interested in a general summary of why from the perspective of a national bank would they loan out a 200k mortgage at a 1 to 1.5% interest rate when they will ultimately lose money on the exchange because of inflation.

It's true that the earned interest on the mortgage is almost as close as you can get to risk-free (since the home can always be repossessed)- but from a personal finance perspective you can imagine that it would seem like a total waste to loan out 200k to earn a 1.5% interest rate since it's not even keeping up with inflation and could've theoretically earned 7% in the stock market. If I as an individual wouldn't even be advised to make such a deal - what's the incentive for a multimillion dollar national bank to engage in millions of these similar transactions ?

Do banks perhaps get government incentives to provide mortgages to citizens ? Or are there perhaps other economic factors that i'm totally missing ?",5,1610989408.0,2021,2021-01-18,,BreezyNate,0,kzyoma

Young couple with inheritance - need guidance (QC),"Hello,


**Who:** My wife and I are both 30 years old, with a combined income of $120K before tax. 


**Where:** We live in, and are employed out of, Gatineau QC.


**What:**

- We fully own our home, a 1500sqft bungalow, valued at $450K. Property taxes are about $5K annually.

- We recently received an inheritance sum of $100,000.

- We _each_ have $10K in a Mutual Fund RRSP through our bank.

- We have about $20K in a regular savings account.


We are able to pay all of our monthly household expenses, and then generally just put whatever's left into savings. Worth noting that we've recently poured about $15K into finishing our basement, and that's where a lot of our remaining monthly money has been going lately.

My main question is what to do with the $100K? I know we need to start _actually_ budgeting instead of winging it. I'm hoping to set that up in a spreadsheet this month, and I'm also looking to chat with an IRL financial advisor. 

That said, I know very little about the different types of bank accounts, or how to get my feet wet with investing. I know a bit about TFSA contributions, and I'm getting the sense that we should start contributing to those. 

I know we are in a very privileged position with these assets; I want to stop sleeping on it and get us set up for the future. 

Any thoughts or advice are appreciated!",4,1610989086.0,2021,2021-01-18,Investing,ThrowAway85371946810,0,kzyk88
Best way to assess risk in a portfolio with securities of different start dates?,"Apologies in advance if this is a bit esoteric.

I'm interested in adding a risk assessment for the various holdings in my portfolio. I'm particularly interested in Sharpe and Sortino Ratios as two measures of return of an investment compared to its risk.  Does anybody have any idea of the best/fairest way of comparing these ratios across different holdings given that some of them only started trading after the big drop in March 2020 and others have been trading for decades?

Would you segment the data by date, i.e. do a calculation for all the securities trading in a given time period and then just calculate new values say every quarter or whatever and add new holdings after they start trading? If so, I understand how that would be ""fair"" per se but I'm trying to wrap my head around whether that that data even still be useful given, for example, Q1 2020 would have a huge downside calculation but the quarters before and after were basically nothing but upsides?

An example from my portfolio: I hold about 20 or so ETFs and individual securities. Among them are XCSR, QQC.F and AC. Air Canada and QQC.F  have been trading for years but XCSR only started trading in late April 2020 so it missed the big Q1 COVID crash entirely. 

Doesn't seem fair to do a calculation that includes XCSR for only a time period when things were going up. But it also seems kind of useless to omit March 2020 from AC and QQC.F's Sharpe and Sortino ratios.",1,1610988971.0,2021,2021-01-18,,thunderbay-expat,0,kzyirf
RRSP contribution usefulness affected by Basic Personal Amount?,"Basically, let's say for example my 2020 income was $60,000 and I am looking to pay ONLY within the lowest tax bracket of 15% (<$48,535), not a dollar over into the 20.5% bracket.

&#x200B;

With the Basic Personal Amount being $13,229, does this mean that my taxable income (assuming no other deductions) is $46,771, nullifying the usefulness of any RRSP contribution? Or would putting $11,465 ($60,000-48,535) bring me to a total taxable income that hits within that 15% bracket, and then be further reduced by the Basic Personal Amount?

"Perspective on happiness and saving, having saved literally nothing during my 20s.","Since I discovered this sub I've learned a lot and it's been a great help. But I have also noticed in myself being far more concerned about money and making the right decisions and getting ahead and this comes with more anxiety and less general well being.

In my 20s I lived with several roommates in east Vancouver, worked to pay my bills and never more. Looking back it was undoubtably one of the best periods of my life. I was care free and I dont know if a value can be put on this. The amount of  fun I had seems impossible to me now, it gave me time to learn about myself, develop wonderful friendships and a long term relationship. I lived in what many wealthy people would probably consider terrible conditions but it honestly never bothered me for I was having such a good time. Let me stress good time does not mean partying, it means exploring life in ways not guided by the stress of always trying to be perfect or maximize potential.

When I'm 60 I doubt I'll look back and wish I had started my career earlier so I could have nicer stuff and a bigger house. The experiences were invaluable and I wouldn't trade them for the world. The goal of all of this is well being and happiness right? This post is sort  of a reminder to myself that one happiest periods of my life was also the poorest. 

So while I save and budget and all that, and dont intend to live the rest of my life in poverty,  I try to remind myself that you only get one shot at this life, and if you spend all your time preparing to live instead of doing so, it might just pass you by. In the end, relationships and experiences are a far more valuable currency.

Edit: For context, in my late 20s I began a union apprenticeship as an electrician. In my mid 30s now, moved to a smaller BC town on Vancouver island, have a house, pension and family.",414,1610981100.0,2021,2021-01-18,,westcoastplant3,1624,kzvxwd

Rectifying TFSA over-contribution after losses (cannot withdraw entire value that was contributed),"Got myself into a pickle as a result of deciding to stay in Europe, instead of my original plan to return this year.

I departed Canada in August 2020, which will be my date of Non-Residency.

In November, I made a TFSA contribution of $20,000 (thinking I'll still be coming back in Canada in early 2021).

But as December progressed, I decided I'm not feeling the idea of going back to Canada right now, decided I'll stay in Europe for a year or two.

Knowing this might impact my TFSA allowance, I sold all my investments and withdrew all my TFSA funds at the end of December.

So if I now file my 2020 taxes as a Non-Resident from August, I'll have an over-contribution for November and December.

Problem.

I over-contributed $20,000.

But I only had $19,875 to withdraw, when I emptied the account (investment losses).

(1) How do I rectify that $125 over-contribution that I can't withdraw?

Because from what I understand, the financial institutions report Contributions and Withdrawals, so CRA will still think I have an over-contribution of $125 in my account...?

(2) I bought and sold a couple investments in the period. I think some had gains, some had losses. Do I need to individually list all of these with a buy/sell price, and pay Non-Resident Investment Withholding Tax on the ones that had a gain?

Supply chain career pathways,"Hey guys, I live in Toronto and I've been working at Metro for 2 months as a Data Supervisor (internship) at Metro.

I don't see myself working in this warehouse long term, rather here for the experience. I can already tell it takes long to move up in comparison to other jobs.

How much should immigrants make in order to live comfortably in GTA?,"By GTA, I mean either vaughan, mississauga, or somewhere similar.

I am planning to immigrate to Canada specifically for better public services, access to the digital economy, and cheaper financing in a stronger currency.

I have a comfortable life in my home country, live with my parents so have no household expenses in terms of rent, no children yet, no other expenses. I have some debts that I will be rid of in a few months time.

I am a content creator specialising in helping brands improve their digital presence through SEO, email marketing, ebooks, online courses, etc. I make enough money that can give me a great life in my home country and I do this as a freelancer so its totally remote. I make roughly 2200-2500 CAD per month. I know that this will help me barely get by anywhere in Canada and I want to know how should I plan my move?

My plans include scaling up this business because it has immense potential but I need access to bank accounts, foreign company set ups, payment platforms etc, things that are not available for an international audience in my home country which is why I am unable to scale beyond where I am currently.

But obviously, there are so many things that can go wrong once I land in Canada, the business might take longer than I expect to scale or might not scale at all. I will be bringing like 15k CAD with me so ill have enough for a few months even if i dont work but I want to know how should I approach this.

Should I try and get a job first in Canada while working on my business? Should I leave my business entirely and pursue a career in seo or digital marketing in GTA? Should I do a soft landing, get my bank accounts and company stuff done and go back?

Of course I am reading up their fee structure on their website but thought I'd ask for some validation here just in case.

Pay Off and Sell VS Keep Truck," When I (22m) graduated high school I left my retail job and got a construction job. With my increased pay I did what many young folks do in my area and I bought a truck from a dealer for $23,500. I had originally wanted a truck for pulling a boat, quads, camper, etc, but I have yet to use it for any of those. 3 years later I still have the truck and I only owe $3600, which I can pay off at anytime. 

 I’ve recently discovered financing and the magic of compound interest. I’ve also recently realized that I have no use for the truck besides the convenience in our Saskatchewan winters. 

 My question for you all is if it’s worth paying it off and selling right away. I believe I can at least get $15k and maybe upwards of $18k for the condition it’s in. If I were to take the loss I’d buy an older car like a Honda Civic for around $3000 and put the rest towards investing. I know it’s more of a personal choice but I need other opinions on if it’s worth selling now or do I keep it and maybe have to put work into it in the near future. 

TLDR: Impulse bought a $23.5k truck from dealer shortly after high school around 3 years ago. Do I take a loss on it now for the extra money for savings/house down payment or investing, or do I keep it and drive it till the wheels fall off.",6,1610946309.0,2021,2021-01-18,Auto,klyboar77,3,kznpmn

"Which option is better - one time Lump Sum ($175,000) or Lifetime Pension ($550 per month)?","I was made redundant at my old job, and therefore I have the above options for collecting my pension. I'm 35 years old and secured a new job 10 days after my last day.

If I choose the Lifetime Pension option, I will receive $550 per month starting at age 60. I will also have access to the group health and dental plan at age 60.

If I choose the Lump Sum option, $60,000 must be transferred into a LIRA or RRSP. The balance will be treated as income, and therefore will be taxable. If I have additional RRSP contribution room, I have the option to transfer the funds there. I will not have access to the group health and dental plan at age 60.

I'm indecisive because of the group benefit plan part. I have only used the group benefits for my dental appointments for my entire life, but I may need it when I'm a retiree. Any advice is appreciated.",36,1610940313.0,2021,2021-01-17,Retirement,AnnaLiseOrr99,4,kzm0qw

Could use some advice /opinions.,"I'm 33 and I graduated from university in 2017. I live in the KW area where I work as a Chemist making about $55k a year.

What to do with inheritance? - 26M Edmonton,"A family member recently passed away unexpectedly with no spouse/kids. I was listed as a beneficiary in his life insurance and pension and expect to receive about \~$100k. I already got the life insurance payout at a little over $60k and we were never told how much the pension was, but were told it's likely to be about $40k. Life insurance is tax free but the pension is taxable, so I'll be sure to keep about 30% tucked away for tax season next year.

&#x200B;

Current situation:

I'm in a relatively low paying (but secure) sales job. It's 100% commission but I'm on a $60k draw which gets wiped clean at the end of 2021. I'm going to have to build my territory up to actually get to the point where I would be making more than that but I'm confident that I can either re-negotiate and go to salary + commission, or find a similar-paying job if needed.

&#x200B;

I've got between $25-30k in student debt ($18k at 3.45% and the rest at 2.45%) and owe about $15k (4.89%) on my car. I've got my car listed with a dealer for consignment right now because I have a company car that I can use for personal use. I was going to sell it myself but figured my time is better used helping the family deal with the passing of my relative and I was okay with taking a loss on it. The car is probably worth about $16k but I expect to get closer to $15k for it after all fees related to it.

&#x200B;

Expenses:

$945/month - Rent + utilities. I'm in my ideal area, in a nice apartment with a great view. Lease is up in July.

$110/month - Phone bill. Financed phone and I use all my data every month. Considering buying it out, buying a phone outright and dropping monthly payments. Haven't looked into it very much.

$70/month - Internet. Reasonable for the area, good speed and unlimited data.

$350/month - Student loan payments. Government loans with relatively low interest rates.

$60/month - Gym (once it reopens).

$280/month - Car payment

$210/month - Car insurance. I already dropped commercial use and usage to minimum, this is as low as it will get.

$400/month - Groceries. Estimate, but it's probably on the higher end. I practically live off yogurt, chicken and broccoli. I buy chicken and broccoli in bulk so it's fairly cheap. I stock up when it's on sale too. I don't really eat out a whole lot, just when I'm out of town for work and it's paid for.

&#x200B;

My after-tax monthly income is about $3,600/month. I just recently got caught up on credit card debt from school and started saving more in the last year or so. I've got \~$7,600 in my TFSA. I'm at about 75% ETFs, 25% stocks. I usually don't hold onto volatile stocks for long and jump out once I've made a fair bit or hold if they're down.

&#x200B;

No cash savings right now, I plan to get that set up once the pension cheque comes in and I know my situation a bit better. I plan on holding about $10k in there, but will probably reassess once I know for sure what I'd like to do with the money. I didn't have much for cash before this and moved a little more than the equivalent of what I had to my TFSA already so I have about $60k sitting in my chequing account right now.

&#x200B;

Now for the questions.

&#x200B;

1. I was planning to start to save up for a down payment with the plan to buy in a couple years. Obviously I have more than enough for a down payment now and I'm confident I could get approved for a mortgage to buy what I want, a downtown condo \~$200-230k. The relative who passed away had a 1200 sq. ft. condo in the neighbourhood I want to live in, but it needs some work - it's worth about $220k. This would also help my parents significantly to know it would move quick because right now they're paying for 3 mortgages and 2 vehicles after having to take on his car payment as well. The emotional side of buying it is that I always dreamt of being like him living there - that was my goal as a kid and it would feel great to live there now. The place needs some work - I would paint the entire place and replace about 200 sq. ft. of flooring. The kitchen cabinets and light fixtures need to be replaced (or at least painted) relatively soon as well. It's in a highly desirable location for provincial government employers, and therefore could be a great rental property in the future, especially if I fix it up a bit.

The other option would be to buy a similarly priced condo in the same area. His is in the least ideal spot in the neighbourhood, but only about a 10 minute walk from where I would prefer to be. I can buy something closer to 900 sq. ft. that's significantly nicer inside that won't need any work. I'm in about 800 sq. ft. right now, so I know I can live comfortably in that. Since gyms shut down, I've got a pretty full home gym set up now, and I can absolutely appreciate a little extra space.

I'm very split between these two options, or to just keep renting even. Lots of people are trying to talk me out of buying a condo, and to get a house instead. That's not affordable where I want to live, and I would actually prefer condo/townhouse anyways. I'm open to opinions on this one.

2) If I do buy a place, I'm not convinced the first time homebuyer's incentive program is worth it. I can put some of the money in an RRSP now and use it, but then I'm committing to using it this year. That's not entirely a bad idea, the pension money will obviously bump my taxable income up a fair bit. I just worry that it could be better used further down the road when my income is higher than it is now. The mortgage broker I spoke with before also seemed hesitant but didn't go too far into that. I can schedule a call with her to clarify before moving forward too obviously. Is there any reason I wouldn't want to take advantage of this?

3) I'm hesitant to rush out and pay off any debts. With student loan interest being a write-off, it seems crazy to do it too quick. Obviously market gains are likely to be higher than the car interest as well, so it feels like that would be a bit of a waste. The mortgage broker said the approval can be subject to paying off all remaining debt if needed, so I'm not worried about it impacting my odds of being approved. Is there anything I'm not considering here, and would it make more sense to pay it off or take my time?

Seeking advice from experienced PFC members,"Hi all,

I've very much appreciated reading all of your posts and finally decided to post something myself. After maxing my RRSP/TFSA and buying a primary residence, I've reached a bit of a financial plateau, so I'm looking for ideas about potential next steps to continue making forward progress. My two financial goals are basically 1) to upgrade from a simple condo to more of a 'forever home' at some point in the next 5-10 years and 2) to have the option to retire or work part-time ASAP. 

My current assets:

* $230k in RRSP 
* $90k in TFSA
* $55k in non-registered investments
* $150-200k in home equity
* $60k in cash

All investments are globally-diversified low-cost equities with a sprinkle of REITs. 

I'm a single 36-year-old. Barring any changes, my income for the foreseeable future will vary between $50-100k per year pre-tax. Expenses are fairly low.

I'm not sure if I should basically just stay the course and continue saving a few thousand bucks a month vs. invest in a second property vs. sell my condo and look for a house immediately. 

Personal finances are a sensitive topic; I'm aware that I'm privileged/doing well and am grateful, but also hate sometimes feeling like a wage slave. Any ideas, insight or feedback from your experience - whether about my financial situation or mindset - would be much appreciated.

Near Retirement - Investing in RRSP vs. Non-Registered Account,"Hey Reddit,

I'm trying to help my parents work on their finances just before they both retire; my Dad retired last year and my Mom will be retiring this year. My mom has a pension with the Municipal Pension Plan, but my Dad does not and they have never invested in RRSPs or TFSAs. They sold a second property a couple years ago and have approximately $300,000 in a savings account gaining basically 0 interest. 

I'm a little weary of them putting all of that money as one big chunk into ETFs (thinking 40% stocks/60% bonds?), so I am thinking of having one parent max out their TFSA contribution (\~$75K) into a TFSA with an online bank as they are currently offering 2.3%. Then with the other parent, I was thinking they could invest the \~$75K in their Questrade TFSA in ETFs , but spreading the contribution over a year to dollar cost average. Then once that is done, we could look into transferring my Mom's TFSA from the online bank to Questrade (and possibly invest it in a shorter time frame than a year). 

Since they have some leftover money from the $300K, I am unsure as to what account they should use for this. I initially thought it would be nice to invest a big chunk into an RRSP account this year (again, probably start with the online bank as they are also offering 2.3% for that and I don't want to just fully jump into investing in the market), but since my Mom is already in a fairly low tax bracket, I'm unsure if this is the right choice. When this money is withdrawn, the full amount is taxed, correct? So you almost get the money now in terms of RRSP tax deductions, but have to pay almost all of it back later since she is not in much of a higher tax bracket right now? And with non-registered accounts, you only pay on the amount you have earned through interest? Is there a bit of a general rule they should follow here?

I'm trying to research as best as I can (now for myself as well), but I've kind of taken this on as they were not doing anything before, so I figure this is better than nothing. But I definitely have put some pressure on myself; I don't want to tell them to do the wrong thing! Thanks and sorry for the long explanation.",6,1610925131.0,2021,2021-01-17,,RedTheRocket,2,kzhh8w

Question about apartment rent increase,"I am currently living in a highrise building in Hamilton, ON in a 2 bedroom apartment with a roommate. In about April or May my roommate will most likely be moving away for school. I really like this apartment and the location and I want to stay, I’m planning to hopefully try and find another roommate (as not doing so will effectively double my rent). We moved in almost 3 years ago, and now rents have risen so they are about approx. $300+ higher than they were we moved in. When we moved in, we put her name down as the “primary applicant” and then I applied to be her “roommate” on their online portal. My question is, if she leaves and I stay at the apartment, will I be subject to a large rent increase since technically the lease is under her name and I’m her “roommate”? Or will I be protected from a large rent increase as I have been living here for 3 years and am continuing to live here?

Zero-Interest In Store Financing Credit Cards,"Canadian Tire Bank (Canadian Tire) offers a credit card that not only collects in-store money, but also allows the option to finance purchases over $150 with equal 24-month payments at zero interest.

This is a really interesting concept, considering it also covers Sportchek, Marks, and other Canadian Tire Family companies. This allows the cardholder to make large purchases and pay for them over time, or delay the payment for a later date.

I am a personal holder of this card and have enjoyed the ability to not only collect points at Canadian Tire, which can be used at a number of stores, but also finance larger purchases and pay for them over time with zero interest.

If you were given the option to finance at **ZERO** interest, why wouldn't you?

My question is whether there are other companies that offer similar, if not identical plans? I would love to, for instance, finance a large technological product, such as a high-quality computer monitor, at a relevant retailer.

Dollar cost averaging vs lump sum with TFSA in an uncertain market?,"Two questions really:

1. Dollar cost averaging vs lump sum? I read a lot of different opinions on this but my believe is time in the market is usually better.
2. Related to that. I have just maxed out the new TFSA allowance - but the markets are weird and i feel like they are going to tank. Meaning that i lose out by having just maxed out my TFSA at the start of the year. Usually with a non-registered account this drop in prices would be when i buy more.  Since i have maxed out my limit - i can't buy more to take advantage of any drop can I? Regardless of market going up or down the limit is the amount you put in not the amount that is in there.

Say the market took a huge nosedive - and i have just maxed out my TFSA.

Are bond funds generally going to be a problem in 2021? (For a Canadian RRSP/TFSA),"I look at videos and articles by various financial advisors and I seem to get a mixed opinion.  Rates are at an all time low and need to start trending up sometime.  Most popular bond funds seem to have a 6 to 8 year duration while short term bond funds have a duration of about 3 years.

Do I need to worry about interest rate risk in 2021? Are bond funds with a duration of 6 years too risky now? Should I go for funds with short term bonds?  Or even money market funds?

Context: I am about 60 years old and are rebalancing my investments away from a equity heavy allocation.  Still have a 8 year timeframe.  (The exact ratio between equities and bonds is another discussion, and I see that the recommendations are all over the map)

Some financial advisors say that you should just go ahead as the price of the assets will rise again as old bonds are sold and new bonds are purchased.

But more importantly, until she does find another job, any job, she's in big trouble. Her sickness benefits are almost up, but it seems that the issue may be permanent.

Question regarding carring on a business in TFSA account,"Hello everyone, I'm having some concerns with my TFSA account  right now. Please help me out.

1. Currently I have less than 30k in my TFSA account.  I have made over 100 trades last year on my TFSA account, however, I did not make any money , I wonder if that consderate as carring on a business which may result a pently in the future .
2. Let say I start to invest long term from now and made lots money after 5  years. Will  CRA look back into the  100 trades I made earlier on  which did not really make any profit therefore use it as an evidence to determine I have carried on a business and  tax my long term gain  .
3. I have more than 30 stocks in my portfolio for long term invesment atm and all of them are bluechips stock , however, I contanly change my mind and switch stocks around  to make a better porfolio  .  I have made 24 trade this month,  and I still want to sell some securties which I just bought few days ago (many of them will to be sold at a loss) and just buy ETF instead (Too many stocks really gives me headache and I think ETF is a better option for TFSA)  without  intention of  making  profit . If I sell the stocks I just bought few days ago the trades will add up to 50 for this month. I wonder if the action above will  rise a flag as carrying on a business  . My intention is to build a better long term porfolio without having  the  intention to speculate,

So I have a friend who has their investments in World Financial Group which I know is an extremely sketchy organization, and I am trying to convince her to pull her investments from the company.

Choosing between TDDI and TD Goal Assist,"I've committed to CCP portfolio, but I haven't set up any account yet. I'm evaluating my pros and cons with different brokerages, accounts, and funds.

The gist of it: I am trying to choose between TDDI e-series, and the new TD Goal assist with free TD ETFs.

Here is more about me:

* Early 20s
* I use TD Bank for my personal banking
* I want to purchase a home in the upcoming 8 years

My options:

* OPTION 1: TDDI account with e-series (**no commission fees for e-series)**
   * 25% **TDB900** International Stock Index, **MER: 0.5%**
   * 25% **TDB911** Canadian Stock Index, **MER: 0.31%**
   * 25% **TDB902** US Stock Index, **MER: 0.33%**
   * 25% **TDB909** Canadian Bond Market Index, **MER: 0.48%**
* OPTION 2: TD Goal Assist (**no commission fees for TD ETFs**)
   * 25% **TTP** TD Canadian Equity Index ETF, **MER: 0.06%**
   * 25% **TPU** TD U.S. Equity Index ETF, **MER: 0.09%**
   * 25% **TPE** TD International Equity Index ETF, **MER: 0.2%**
   * 25% **TDB** TD Canadian Aggregate Bond Index ETF, **MER: 0.09%**
   * (I was additionally considering **TEC** TD Global Technology Leaders Index ETF, **MER: 0.39%**)

I want to have opinions regarding specifically which account I should go for, and why.

Goal Assist is attractive because of their low MERs. It's also very convenient, and I get free money for opening one and contributing before march according to the rep I spoke with on the phone.

If anyone has advice regarding my portfolio and allocations, I'll happily take it. 

Thank you!

Would maxxing out your RRSP throughout your life lead to an overshoot in savings?,"I am 23 and saving my money in an RRSP  and my TFSA is already full. Currently I am maxxing out my RRSP.

Using the 4% rule that is 128000 a year. Add in CPP and other government benefits and a paid off house, it seems like that would be a relative oversavings and a potentially tax inefficient one.

TFSA trustee for minor vs trustee in the will,"I have recently had a second child, and am updating some investment documents. We have a family friend as our trustee in our wills (which we are also getting updated to accommodate the new child)/ As I was filling the beneficiary forms for my TFSA, I noticed that there is a section for a trustee that states ""If any of your beneficiaries is a minor right now, you must name a trustee"". I honestly can't remember doing this when my first child was born, as I think I just had my spouse as the only beneficiary and didn't name my child specifically. I am also changing my spouse to successor at this time, so that is likely why I didn't have my child as a bene before. 

So my question is, since we have a trustee setup in our wills, do I even need to make my children beneficiaries on our TFSAs? Wouldn't these accounts just end up in control of the trustee that we have designated in our wills? I'm thinking I can just switch my spouse from beneficiary to successor, and that is it, but thought I should check.",3,1610916603.0,2021,2021-01-17,,jadeddog,0,kzeoaw

Cancelled Sun Life appointment. Now: all in on WS?,"Summary from [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/jmp0yq/no_pf_knowledge_has_200k_from_house_sale/): I have basically no PF knowledge. Sold a house in NS, have about $200K and no debt, but no investments.

Last month, I took everyone's advice and cancelled my meeting with the financial advisor from Sun Life. I bought The Millionaire Teacher and am working my way through it. I'm learning what the acronyms mean. I opened a TFSA with WealthSimple (but haven't put anything into it yet).

I'm the sort of person that's slow to make decisions, and wants to know I'm doing the right thing via research, or by deferring to a professional. Your responses to my post convinced me I should learn the basics and not hand my money to Sun Life. (Or any of the people who PM'd me saying they should be my financial advisor. 🤔)

As far as I can tell, WealthSimple doesn't let you choose particular ETFs. If The Million Teacher has taught me anything, however, it's that hand-picking your investment won't beat broad diversification plus patience. Given that WS's whole deal is investing broadly, does it make sense to just... give the robo-investor as much as I can, and let it handle that diversification? Or should I also diversify the *platforms* I'm investing with? I bank with BMO — maybe I should figure out InvestorLine and buy some ETFs there?

So, potentially:

1. Put $75,500 into my WealthSimple TFSA (the max allowed for someone who's never put money into a TFSA)
2. Put the remainder into ETFs somehow, maybe through BMO InvestorLine self-directed.
3. Wait.

Would this be doing the right thing? I'm feeling a little out on a limb, and want assurance that I'm not making a terrible mistake. :)  Thank you!",9,1610914999.0,2021,2021-01-17,,IWillMissYouHouse,0,kze5c6

How soon after I deposit money to my Lifelong Learning Plan can I withdraw from it?,"My common law partner is finishing their bachelor's degree this spring and will have to pay back their student loans afterwards.

New job with $100k salary (pre-tax). How do I calculate true take home income (Toronto) and how much is acceptable to pay rent?,"I've currently made a career jump to a job that pays $100,000 per year, and a 5% bonus in Ontario. I'm currently not counting on the bonus in my budget for some wiggle room and for the bonus to probably be used for ""fun money"" at the end of the year. I graduated from University two years ago and have about $4,000 left on my OSAP, low interest (floating rate usually around 2-5%). I am apartment shopping to live on my own in the downtown area, knowing there are some really great rent cuts due to the pandemic. My initial budget was $2,000 per month in rent alone (separate budget for utilities, insurance, internet, etc). I work from home now due to covid restrictions, I do not want to live with room mates.

**I was initially using the 50/30/20 rule. 50% of my after tax income goes to set costs (Rent, utilities, insurance) 30% goes to day-to-day and lifestyle costs (groceries, hobbies, gas) and 20% goes to debt, retirement, and emergency fund.**

I plan to automatically deduct a minimum of 5% of my pay check to RRSP contributions, and took that off of my total ""take home pay"". I'm having a hard time calculating my exact monthly budget after tax, CPP, EI, etc. to know my true ""ceiling"" for the month so I can apply the budget rule noted above. Would it be absurd to be paying $2500 a month for a really nice place in the city (townhouse unit, 1 bedroom plus den for my office, ample living space) or should I stick my guns to a $2,000 p/month unit in what would probably be a high-rise condo unit with less space?

I am 24 years old and hope to purchase a condo by 30, but also want to be able to live a comfortable lifestyle given the current restrictive circumstances  (lockdown etc.).

"Landlords of Canada, preferably Quebec, how would I, a tenant, evict an occupant I'm renting to?","So long story short, I've always just had occupant roommates that pay me rent and I pay to the land lord, with my name on the lease.

I told the roommate in November I was planning to move in March (verbally) and sent him a text message Jan 3rd saying the moving date was finalized. He asked me (in text) for the land lord's contact info to apply, so I gave him the previous lease from a previous property with all the info on it.

He never contacted the land lord. He sent me a text saying he needed the contact info, which I provided, then confirmed later he never did get in contact with him.

Fast forward to today, land lord has some other tenants lined up, occupant is talking about suing the land lord for discrimination because after the roommate basically shouted in the land lord's face for saying he wanted to have multiple applicants before deciding that the land lord was racist and discriminatory.

Obviously after that conversation the land lord had no interested in dealing with him.

So now that the march 1st date is locked in and also new tenants are moving in, the current occupant roommate is talking about suing and I'm stuck living with this shit.

Credit Report - Credit Card Closed Help!,"Hello Everyone!

I need some help.

I recently looked at my credit report and it looks like a credit card I had closed back in 2018 had a remaining balance. I KNOW that I paid it off and can only assume that it was maybe the monthly fee that was charged after I had asked to close the account?

Regardless on my credit report now it says that I missed about 4 months of payments on the credit card from back in 2018 and it was sent to collections.

However when I look at the collections section of my report it says there is nothing outstanding.

I have read on this community that sometimes you can offer to pay the amount that was sent to collections in exchange for them taking it off your credit report. However in my case it doesn't look like it was actually sent?

Is it realistic to reach out to Scotiabank to try to get them to take it off my credit report?

Should I start collecting HST/GST for my Freelancing side-job?,"[ONTARIO]

Hello everyone,
Last year I started working for the first time as a freelancer along with my main job. Sole proprietorship under my full name.

I worked November and December, continuing into this year but I haven't invoiced last year's work yet. I plan to do it now. Together with January, I earned $6k so far.

Doing some research online, I found you don't need an HST/GST number to collect taxes if your freelancing income is lower than 30k.

Question 1: is invoicing for last year's work allowed? I'm assuming the income will just be taxed for this year, instead of last year

Question: How do I know at this point whether my income by year-end will be over or under 30k? Because if it will, I should charge my client HST now, but if it won't, then I shouldn't. I'd like to avoid a situation where my client is charged for just my work, but then I need to pay HST from my hourly wage.

How can I utilize a Home Buyers' Plan (HBP) withdrawal made after closing on a property?,"Seller has accepted a conditional offer that my spouse and I made on a townhouse. Before we made the offer, I was expecting to make the down payment using a combination of my own funds and a gift from my parents. However, when the offer was accepted, my spouse's parents unexpectedly decided to gift her a large sum of money to increase the size of our down payment. 

I want my spouse to take advantage of the HBP, but our planned closing date is March 22, 2020 (in 63 days). Therefore, if my spouse deposited the gifted money on Monday (January 18, 2021), we would not be able to withdraw the funds until April 18, 2021 (after the closing date) due to the 90-day rule. 

I see that we are allowed to make HBP withdrawals within 30 days after closing. I have enough cash to add another $35k of funds from my TFSA to the down payment if needed (initially I had saved this for renovations). So my question is, **can we use the HBP funds that my spouse withdraws after the closing date to repay me for:**

**2) Closing costs (land transfer tax, title insurance, legal) that I incur on the closing date?**

Career change at 30 - tech or accounting?,"Hello r/personalfinancecanada!

I have a BA, Geography degree and have worked a variety of administrative/record management type roles since I graduated in 2014.  I recently turned 30 and would like to start working towards an actual career as soon as possible. I'm having difficulties progressing past the \~$50/55k/year jobs and am realizing I will likely need to get additional training/pursue a different field if I want to secure a higher paying job.

* I worry about ageism/sexism in tech related careers. I've come across a lot of articles/posts about women leaving tech due to how they are treated.
* Through my research, the starting salary for accounting positions seems to trend very low which concerns me.  I realize that the salary progression usually occurs quite quickly though which is reassuring. 
* My post secondary education does not include any accounting or comp sci courses. I realize there are quite a few free online resources for learning web development, but I would feel more comfortable receiving a credential from an accredited institution. 

Any insights into what career would be the best path for financial growth at this point in my life would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",41,1610901590.0,2021,2021-01-17,,pfccareerhelp,8,kz9oge
Is there a risk in investing in an ETF,"It is accepted that VEQT and XEQT are similar products that can be used interchangeably.
I also get that ETF are traded on the market at a slightly different price than the NAV.
Is there a risk of an ETF being less interesting.
I can think of 2 situations.


Lets say that XEQT lowers their MER to .05%. Is there a risk that a lot of people want to sell VEQT to switch their assets and the price of what is offered is a lot less than the NAV value or is there some kind of automatism or something.

Same thing i know VEQT changed the composition of the stock a while back if for a reason it becomes less attractive than some other companies ETF is it possible for it to lose more value than the NAV?

Im pretty sure theres some kind of mechanism that existes that im mot aware of or that I underestimate how “new” people will want to buy the ETF  that is too low compared to the NAV, but im just curious if there is some kind of risk of an ETF losing popularity suddenly!",6,1610901133.0,2021,2021-01-17,,urbanp4d,0,kz9jft

Minimizing transaction fees,"TD web broker charges $10 per purchase of ETFs. I contribute $100 per month so if I purchase every time I contribute the cost will be 10%. How do I balance the cost of the transaction to missing out on the market? With the fee this high does it make sense to purchase every six months? three months? every month?

I can’t switch to a different broker because as far as I can tell there are no brokers with a lower fee that support registered disability accounts. 

It is possible to purchase mutual funds without any transaction fee. I think this is the safest option because I would be in the market as soon as possible. But I don’t know any mutual funds that higher high-risk and globally diversified. 

In this situation is the management fee lower purchasing ETFs less regularly or mutual funds with no transaction fee?

Parties involved in Buying a Condo,"Hi,

I am 33 yr old single M. Somehow, I have saved enough funds to buying a condo in Toronto. My price range is 500 - 600k

My question is what and how many parties do I need to have in retainer to go through with my plans. I feel putting half a million is a large chunk and most parties involved in the process will try to cheat me through the process.

I met a remax real estate agent who said I will have to sign up with him exclusively to buy a condo. I have never seen a contract like that but he said it's just so I know I'm not wasting time if I show you the listings. I didn't sign with him but the whole situation made me uneasy.

Anyway, apart from real estate agent, broker and house inspector, are there any other parties I need to involve? Do I find real estate lawyers myself or through my agent. Please let me know your thoughts guys!",19,1610898202.0,2021,2021-01-17,,navyboy007,1,kz8mc0
"Town in Canada that has a cheap COL, transit, hospital?","If I qualify for federal disability (doctor tells me he has had patients with more ability than me qualify) I can move anywhere in Canada and my income will remain the same. It won’t be much but it is guaranteed.

I’m trying to find towns (or cities but far chance of it being a city) where there is transit and a hospital. It doesn’t have to be a big hospital and transit doesn’t have to be fancy, just get me to the grocery store etc once a week. I don’t want to rely on taxis.

If I qualify for disability it goes back ten years so I will get some cash from the retro and it will be enough to buy a cheap house in a small town, but I’m not sure the town will have transit and healthcare.

Does anyone know of some towns with these two requirements and cheap real estate that I can research?

My parents are on the mortgage with me as I could not get approved for the original mortgage amount alone, they will also be co-signing the HELOC as well. My parents and my total monthly income is over $10,000+

Financial coach vs advisor,"Hi guys just looking for some advice as where to focus my search.
I need financial advice in a multitude of ways as I have RRSPs, RESPS, TFSA and a good nest egg in a savings account. I have a good deal of home equity and I am looking to sell my urban home and move to a rural property this year. I have investments in my companies shares but thats about it.

Would I need an advisor or a coach if I wanted to have someone take a complete view of my entire financial situation and plan out a present and future plan for me? 

I don't have a monthly budget or savings plan per say and no active investments. My savings just sit in a bank account year round collecting no interest and I don't max out my TFSAs. 

Is it normal to get a coach to get my current situation on track and then find an advisor to make significant future investments? 

Or can an advisor do both? 

From the few coaches I've seen on here they range from $3,000 plus, realistically in the $5,000 range for a full plan. Would it be a waste if I was to then continue with an advisor going forward?

Crazy to move/sell instead of staying put and paying off mortgage?,"Hey Reddit,

My wife (35F) and I (39M) have lived in our condo townhome in Alberta for about 9 years now, we've been aggressively paying down the mortgage during this time and owe about $50k of our original $150k mortgage on a purchase price of $200k... but emotionally speaking we're over this place.

When we purchased in 2011 we picked this place primarily off what we could afford at the time, and keeping our mortgage payments under $1,000/month. But truth be told we were never crazy about our neighbourhood, and realized a few years ago it really isn't well suited to our lifestyle. It's very aging suburb and while we have excellent access to green space there's really nothing walkable about it at all. It's get in the car, for everything. 

With COVID and working from home for the last 10 months it's felt even more isolating. We're ready to move, but we also know this will mean taking a loss on the property value, so we're trying to find the path that makes the most sense.


Our life situation

- Our household income is about $143k before

- Large emergency fund saved up

- $120k retirement/investments

- Currently contributing about $1,800/month to RRSP (includes an employer match)

- No debt other than mortgage

- Credit rating over 800

- No plans/desire for kids



The condo townhouse situation

- Bought in 2011 for $200k

- Currently owe $50k on mortgage

- Realistically we'd be looking at selling for $150-$180 due to the market in Alberta




In addition to the crappy home value, we got hit with a hell of a special assessment a few years ago for new building exteriors, to the tune of $45k, the complex looks great, but that one stung. So between the tanked prices in Alberta and the assessment we've already had $100k dissolve into thin air... 

At this point we're pretty much over it, we've already had the financial loss here, and we've run out of patience for things ""maybe will be better in 2-3-4-5 years time..."" and hoping for the best.

We're currently mulling a few options, but they all seem like the lesser of 2-3 evils

**1) Attempt to sell and buy at the same time**
- Hopefully we can clear $100-$120k after paying realtor fees & paying off the mortgage balance, then apply that equity to a downpayment. The logistics of this feel challenging in the current market of trying to live here while dealing with showings, and it makes buying harder as it's contingent on a sale

**2) Move into a rental, list the house**
- While this would be the most expensive on the short term, as we'd be paying mortgage/condo fees here, while paying rental elsewhere, it does feel like the most flexible option as if/when it sells we could invest the equity in the meantime and really take our time before buying a new place. Yes, it could mean going back to renting for 2-3 years, but if it's a property I'd enjoy more than what we currently own that may be the better option.

**3) Move into a rental, attempt to rent the townhome**
- This is probably my least favourite option, based on the rental market we wouldn't be left with anything over the cost of the mortgage/condo fees, and truthfully the thought of having tenants or a property manager to deal with stresses me out

**4) Stay put, pay down off the mortgage in the next 5 years**
- This may be the most straight forward responsible option... but it's really quite stifling, we've been living well below our means for the last few years and it's starting to seem silly to be spending so much time in a place we don't love, when truthfully we could afford more.

I couldn’t find any details about the yearly cap for HOOPP or any such restrictions as it exists for RRSP. 

Only thing I found was that if she contributes to HOOPP, then, her RRSP contribution room reduces.

Wanted to be check if she can still contribute to HOOPP without a RRSP room ? Or are there any other restrictions that we should be aware of?

As a new PR we know some friends who accidentally contributed to RRSP and got penalized.",7,1610853397.0,2021,2021-01-16,Investing,rajababoo,1,kyy5g1
Manulife Personal Rate of Return,"Hi all

So I have my RRSP with Manulife and I am confused by their personal rate of return. I looked at the formula and it makes sense but when compared to the actual funds that I hold it stops making sense.

I did send an email to manulife about this but I don't think I will hear back for at least a month given everything.

Since account open as of Sept 2019, it says my personal ROR is 3.7 percent.  
However, for each of my funds that I own, their performance, for the past 2 years, have been consistently higher than that. Even the lowest performing (a bond) is at 3.8% and a US Equity fund is up 16% for the year 2020. 

So here is my problem. How could my personal ROR be LOWER than even the worst performing fund?",12,1610851549.0,2021,2021-01-16,,portol,4,kyxmey

Cancelling an online order,"I live in Ontario.

Near the end of December, I bought a computer monitor online for ~$500, from a Canadian website. It's been weeks and I still haven't gotten any updates on it, and according to the UPS tracking it has been returned to sender without ever entering Canada (it was shipped from the US). According to the tracking, the company got the monitor back on January 4th, but I still haven't recieved any updates on what happened, and my credit card has already been charged.
  
After several customer service calls where I tried to figure out what was going on, I decided to try cancelling my order. The company doesn't have a customer service email though so I had to do this by phone. The customer service guy told me that there was nothing I could do and that they wouldn't refund an order that has already shipped (even though they have it back and still haven't re-shipped it?).  
  
Is there anything I can do about this? I made the purchase through a visa credit card with RBC.

Rolling over 401k from the US,"Hi there,

I'm relatively inexperienced with the ins and outs of complicated tax situations and am looking for any advice or input on folks with experience in rolling over a 401k from the US to a Canadian account.

**Background:**

* Worked in the US for 8+ years at various companies
* Before leaving my final job there and moving back to Canada (where I am a citizen), I rolled over all my 401k accounts into the one provided by my employer at the time
* Since then, that company has been effectively dissolved and thus have cancelled their 401k plan
* As a result, I received a notification from the 401k provider that I need to notify them of how to disburse my funds

**Options:**

The provider's site shows me a few options, including:

1. Rolling over to another provider's 401k (not possible as I am no longer in the US) or equivalent retirement account
2. Creating and rolling over to an IRA with said provider (not sure if this is allowed as I am no longer a ""US person"") for a $5/month fee
3. Early disbursement (which would trigger additional penalties as I am not of retirement age)

I'd like to avoid option 3 for obvious reasons. Has anyone had any experience attempting 1? Or thoughts on the pros/cons of 1 vs 2 (or if 2 is possible for me)? The resources \[1\]\[2\] I've found online seem to indicate it's possible to avoid early disbursement penalties but seem to indicate the process would involve the money effectively being taxed multiple times.

Help using Passiv for Dollar Cost Averageing a large lump sum transfer," 

Hello! I have a 3-fund CCP portfolio with Questrade. I have a hard time visualizing my rebalancing plans and have been using Passiv this year, which has been a great help and allowed me to be more consistent with my investments and contributions. I’m hoping to get some advice:

I’d like to continue using Passiv to help with my allocation purchases BUT I’ve got a large lump sum that will be transferred into my QT account (ex-employer group fund) that I’d like to invest over the next 12 months for a dollar-cost-averaging strategy. As such, my cash holdings will be \~50% of my portfolio and throwing everything out of whack.

I’d ALSO like to continue to invest my monthly contributions as well.

So, keeping this in mind: how can I set up my Passiv portfolio allocation to allow me to dollar cost average the large lump sum + steady contributions?

XAW - 50%, VCN - 25%, ZAG- 25% 

Is this possible? My bad-at-math/finance brain can’t picture this.

"RRSP Contributions, First Time Home Buyers Plan and upcoming 'Gap Year'","Question!

Last year, I was able to buy my first property and also moved into a higher tax bracket than I have achieved in the past, 40% marginal tax rate for reference.

I am currently exploring taking an RRSP Loan for the following reasons;

* Rates are low, seems like a great time to be borrowing money
* Being in this higher tax bracket, makes the return worthwhile
* I can likely invest the money and get a higher return than the 2.45% interest being charged

However given the above, I am concerned as in 2020, I used the first time home buyers plan and pulled 35k out of my RRSP to help me buy my property. It was my understanding that I don't have to get my RRSP back to the 35k I withdrew for 16 years.

With that said, I am curious. If I were to contribute 25k to my RRSP for the year of 2020, does it get cancelled out by my FHBP withdrawal from 2020 or will I still get a tax return on RRSP contribution?

&#x200B;

Also I am normally would not contribute to my RRSP as I do not love the idea of my money being tied up and not being able to deploy it to buying my next home lets say or an investment property. However, I am overlooking this as I plan to take a calendar year off of work in the next 3 years, a 'gap year', and I was thinking of using my RRSP to replace my income essentially while I take this year off.

Am I right in thinking that if I took out less than 41k (the lowest tax bracket in British Columbia is $41,725) in this 'gap year' that it would get taxed at the lowest tax bracket in that gap year? There is no other tax penalties from the government in using your RRSP like this?

If that was the case, then that would be huge as it I would be able to take this loan, ideally make a decent ROI, over the interest paid, get 40ish% back in taxes and then take it back out in a few years at a 20ish% tax rate. Am I missing anything big here?",8,1610843871.0,2021,2021-01-16,,miketaycan,0,kyvcqo

How should you split costs/ownership when co-owning a house?,"**Hello!**

My sister and her husband are looking at buying a house in Hamilton with my common-law partner and myself and we are wondering what standard practices exist for unequal ownership. 

I've looked for resources online about this, but some are very unhelpful and tell us generally what we should consider, but does not give examples of what is a standard practice. Or if they do consider situations, they usually only discuss 50/50 situations, with 50/50 equal down payments and 50/50 ownership. And, maybe that is the answer - we should compensate our payments so in essence we are 50/50 owners to make things straightforward. But I would like guidance if that is the case, please!

**Our situation:**

For an example house we looked at, it was a duplex that was not a 50/50 split - one unit was significantly larger than the other. Let's say for example's sake it was 60/40 in terms of size/amenities.

And, as far as the down payment, I can afford to pay well above my share because I have no debts and have been saving for some time, while my sister and her husband, although they have the higher combined income also have many debts from other education they have taken and have not been able to save much yet. 

**If my sister and her husband own the larger portion of the house, but I pay the larger portion of the down payment, how can we split ownership?**

Should they pay a larger portion of the mortgage? Should we factor into those mortgage payments my down payment, so my partner and I pay less monthly mortgage payments until that down payment is ""paid off""? Or should we just split everything 50/50 for simplicity's sake, with my down payment taken into consideration if we sell the house from one party to the other, or outright? 

Any guidance, experience, recommendations would be appreciated, thanks!",8,1610837022.0,2021,2021-01-16,,ZenBowling,1,kyt8oh

Capital One MasterCard,"Hi all!

I hope you’re well. I have a question regarding my MasterCard that I have with Capital One. 

This is my longest standing credit account and is in good standing. I got this card when my credit was poor, as it was the only one I could get. It has no rewards or cash back and has an annual fee of $60. It has the higher limit out of the two cards that I have.

I now have a Visa with Simplii in addition to this (and have had it for more than 6 months now). This card is cash back and has no annual fee. I use this over the MC anytime I need to use a card for a purchase for obvious reasons. 

I understand that the MC is generally positive as it’s my oldest standing credit account. I thought maybe I could upgrade to a better card but no, Capital One Canada does not offer this. 

So, do I continue to pay annually for this card just on the basis that it is my oldest account? Or am I better off to close it? Will my credit take a hit if I close it? 

My thinking is that closing it is the best option. But I want to be sure and hope others might have been in a similar situation and can offer their insights.

Two RRSP accounts and parents don't know why?,"Hi, 

My parents (dad 68 and mom 64 yrs of age) had an accountant handle their investments and tax returns before but this individual passed away from COVID. My parents never found a new accountant since they are both afraid of catching COVID.

My parents each have their own TFSA and RRSP account. My dad has been the only one working for 30+ yrs and my mom stopped working in her early 30's to be a stay at home mom.

When I log into their TD direct investing accounts, my dad has 1 x TFSA and 1 x RRSP account but my mom has 1 x TFSA and 2 x RRSP accounts. One RRSP account has stocks with a market value of $10K and the other RRSP account has $250K. 

My parents don't know why my mom has 2 x RRSP accounts and when we asked TD, they don't know either.

What I think is...since my dad has been the only one working, his annual deduction limit was split into his personal and my mom's RRSP. That could explain my moms $250K RRSP account. The smaller RRSP account could be her personal one that she opened up in her 30's but forgot about?

Is buying a house still worth it?,"I bought a house in the GTA about 5 years ago. Thought it was expensive then, oh man did things get worse. So I would like to use my buddy as an example in this scenario who bought more recently.

He bought about 2 years ago in the GTA. Him and his wife bought a 800k house in the GTA. Of course in the GTA 800k gets you a house that needs work. They decided to only put down 10% instead of the initial 20% because they realize they would need money left over for renos. So all the remaining money they sunk into sweat equity, as well they are currently paying more towards the interest than the principle amount. They make decent money together. Gross income together I would estimate at about 200K. However it will be awhile until they pay off that house. They plan on having kids soon too. So is it really worth it? I mean how much more will housing go up in value. How much more will it need to go up in value for them to get their money back? Who will buy it in the future for even more money?

Churning Credit Cards to Maximize Rewards. Is it worth it?,"Hi,

I've lurked this community for some time now and it has quickly risen to the top of my favorite subreddits but this will be my first post here.

My credit card is up for renewal next month and I've been spending the past few weeks trying to decide if it's time to change or if I'm better off sticking with what I've got. I mainly look towards Cash Back cards as I've had rewards cards in the past but the rewards never seem to be worthwhile.

I currently have the CIBC Visa Infinite Card. As of Feb 1st, the perks will be changing to 4% Grocery & Gas, 2% Recurring, Dining, & Transportation, 1% everything else. This has been my only card I've used for everything since 2016 and I've had almost all my banking through CIBC (aside from my mortgage) for my entire life. They are also increasing the Annual Rate so going forward will cost $120/year which seems to be the new norm for these cards. I did give CIBC a call and they basically laughed when I asked if I could be eligible again for new cardholder bonuses since I've been a loyal CIBC customer for so long. 

After going over my 2020 expenses. I've realized the majority of my spending is grocery with the amounts on Gas and Recurring being very similar and coming in second. With the pandemic happening and working from home full time, plus taking on a few additional recurring expenses late in 2020, I suspect my Recurring will be more than gas in 2021.

That being said, after going through all the Big Bank cash back cards, I've been enticed by the Scotia Visa Infinite. The major difference with this card from the CIBC one is 4% back on Recurring with only 2% back on Gas, but only 1% back on dining. If it was that alone I doubt it would be worth it just because I think the difference in cash back will be negligible, I'm eligible for the new cardholder sign up bonuses which is 10% Cashback on up to $2k spent in the first 3 months + no annual fee for the first year (an extra $320 by my calculations).

Now going further down the rabbit hole, 95% of my gas purchases are from Petro-Canada because I collect Petro-points. If I get an RBC MasterCard with a $0 annual fee I can save 3cents/L + an additional 20% in Petro-Points.

My major concern and after spending hours going crazy researching cards and trying to figure of the best deal is: Is this all worth it? I know that closing and opening new cards will take a hit to my credit score, I haven't been able to find online how big of hit roughly, I do have a good score as it is (>780) and I don't expect to need to utilize it any time soon so I should be able to rebuild no problem. Does anyone know how big of a hit it would be to open 2 new cards? Is the difference of maybe a few hundred bucks worth the hassle of managing multiple cards from multiple institutions? It is convenient to have my CC and accounts under a single online banking and have payments be authorized right away. 

 I feel like I'm already falling deeper into the rabbit hole.. Wal-Mart has a rewards card and they don't count as grocery on with VISA despite spending thousands per year on only grocery items.. 

I would just like to know what others think, is it worth it to churn, or in the end are the headaches not worth the rewards?

Any thoughts and opinions are appreciated. Thanks in advance!",7,1610829249.0,2021,2021-01-16,,joenigz,0,kyqssx

Bank keeps reporting on closed revolving line of credit,"Hi there,

I have an account that I have not paid off in a couple of years. I want to fix my credit so I called the bank to see what can be done. They sold it to collections and they cannot help me. I tried calling that collection agency and they said they don't have it anymore either. And they couldn't tell me where it is now. So I have no idea how to pay off this loan as the bank will not accept the money however they keep reporting my resolving credit (it says the account is closed) and it's dropping my credit points by 30 every single month.

"Experiences, thoughts, and recommendations on how to evaluate financial advisors","Hi everyone, appreciate all the comments and info from this thread and had a few questions on financial advisors.

I was planning on going to see a financial advisor to help sort out my finances  and long term goals. Despite that though Ive noticed I don’t see a lot of advice on going to one in forums like this, or even know many people who do, and I’m curious as to why. 

Because of that I had a few starter questions i was hoping to some responses on. 

1.Are they really worth it? This seems like a simple question but again given how helpful I would imagine them to be I feel like a lot more people should be trying to find one. 
2. Is there a minimum $ threshold you need to have to get one? Is that why more people don’t go? 
3. What are common fee structures, are they considered “expensive” compared to just finding information yourself online? 
4. How can you evaluate a “good” one? What are some common questions, concerns etc?

Any past experiences with financial advisors would also be really helpful. Might very well be stupid questions and if so feel free to let me know haha

"Advice for a family of two. Investing, banking and options available.","Hello everyone,
I just wanted to start by saying I wish the best to all and their families right now.

Sorry for the story book, as well as any spelling/grammatical errors, phones aren't always the best.

I'm 28 y/o with two children, one that will be 3 and the other 1 soon. 

I started really saving after I had my first. I'm not able to save much but I try. I have a TFSA, HISA, Family Mutal/RESP and a RRSP. I've been seeing people talk about GTCs, ETF and EQ Bank.

My goal, is retire early, earlier then retirement age. To provide my kids with whatever education I can help provide them as well as be financially stable enough to withstand spirts of work or a rainy day should something go really wrong.

My first question is bank choice. I am with TD and have been since I began banking/had my first job and pay cheque. I am not happy with them. More due to customer service, and their seeming lack of knowledge/competence (I had to go back to the bank 4 times to have my mutual funds done, the last time being she filed the paperwork out wrong.) With the way this keeps going they don't deserve me or my money/investments.. as I have seen others say on here.. banks are in it for themselves. With that being said is TD a good option for me, my spouse is with Servus and honestly they look more appealing at this stage in my life. I've also seen people comment about an ""EQ bank"" I've briefly looked this up, but wouldn't mind more information.

Second is investing. From what I've been seeing/reading I should be doing my best to max out my TFSA, put my RRSP on hold until fulfilling the max contribution in the TFSA. I started family mutal plan for my two kids and do about a 100-200 a month into them. Mutal funds scare me, more because I'm not 100% sure where my money is going, if I will make any and any fees associated with them, I feel like it's good but I am worried if my kids never use it, if I can end the family mutal and transfer to a different mutal or if I can put it in savings? Lack of knowledge on my part, I like having a plan. Should I continue to to contribute to them? Or also put that on hold until I max my TFSA for the year. I make about 40k a year (not on mat) but am on maternity leave currently, returning in March. I've seen people talking about ETF (similar to a mutual?), GIC and an EQ Bank, I assume just for the added interest rate? Should I be getting involved in this?

Edit: Third question deleted. (Age requirement, for account).

Not sure if this is part of this thread, and I apologize if this is something that shouldn't be posted, first time here.
Last question. Child care is still up in the air with current world events but I like knowing options and services available to me.. I know I can apply for a subsidy when/if I put my kids in daycare due to the amount my family will bring in. I guess I'm not 100% looking for more subsidy information but rather maybe tax write offs or useful information you found? That could help me save more for my family? We currently use a local tax guy (out of home) to file is there additional things I can give him or inform him of that would benefit us?

Adding VFH to my portfolio?,"I am doing this through Questrade as a dual citizen so through margin account. Currently holding VT exclusively as my all in 1 ETF and invested for the long term (10 years minimum).

I was thinking of adding this to my holdings and then purchasing individual shares of the Canadian banks through wealth simple trade (I also hold a good chunk of a big 5 cad through my work plan). 

I feel uncertain about the banks success long term. We saw some major US FIs eat shit after 2008 but maybe I’m thinking about it too much.

Reliance Water Heater Rental,"So I have owned my home now since June 2017 and we have a rented water heater from the previous owner.

We are paying $35/ month for this. This is my first home and I was absolutely oblivious to these types of things simply because I had never had to deal with it in the past.

I travel for work so we decided to keep renting because I was only home 2-3 months throughout the year and the idea that my wife wouldn't have to worry about anything because it is rented.

Now that I am in a position where I am home much more often and we are a bit more well established and educated with home ownership I am re-evaluating a lot of things in our home.

Obviously by now the water heater has been well paid off and we are just throwing money at Reliance for nothing.

Is it worth me to call them and see how much time is left on the rental agreement / buy the unit out from them?

We are expecting another transfer within the next 12 months so we will be moving again- is it worth it? Should I just keep the rental for the rest of the year and worry about this on my next home?

Any advice appreciated- looking to save some cash

I'm afraid I won't be successful in Canada. I am struggling with a career goal.,"My husband is in the military and my school was postponed by a year, we have one toddler, another on the way and plan to stop at two kids. We have over ten grand in savings(don't feel comfortable disclosing the exact amount) and we are renting in military housing since it's what's most affordable and least likely to drastically increase in cost. We're hoping to save to get a home, but it's not as much of a priority anymore as having an emergency savings account given the dramatic increase in housing costs. 

I was always a quiet loner, most of my middle school and highschool days I was forced to stay home to care for my siblings, I developed mental health issues and that resulted in social services intervening. I got kicked out and was homeless, landed up dropping out and getting a job at McDonalds and a roommate. I got therapy. I got my GED and was able to get a loan to go to school to upgrade. I was never very smart with math or chemistry, I managed a 86 in Chem and an 80 in math but I spent what felt like four-six hours a night trying to understand and still messing up. Writing came easily, but that's not what gets people stable, six figure careers... 

I landed up getting into the LPN program because it was what I could afford, I did my first year but so far it just seems like grueling shift work where you're forced to try and care for a hundred people all within twelve hours and walk home with maybe $40,000 a year if you're lucky. That's not enough to afford a home in Canada or care for my two children, let alone get my husband out of the Navy so he doesn't need to spend seven months at sea and miss his children growing up...

Issues with putting savings for down payment in Real Return Bonds?,"My girlfriend has about $30k in savings that she would like to use as her contribution to our first home downpayment. We’re looking to purchase in about 12 months time.

Currently all her savings are in a regular bank savings account. I’ve been reading more about possible inflation risks ahead and wondered if something like a Blackrock Real Return Bond ETF would be a smart hedge against that risk. I’m new to bonds and wondering what the pitfalls of choosing real returns over normal bonds may be - is it better to hold cash given the time horizons?

QuickBooks questions for a contractor,"Background: In 2020 during the start of the pandemic, I was was laid off during lockdown, and when that ended (late May), my job was no longer available, but I was given the opportunity to finish the project as a subcontractor with no strings attached afterward. The project continued until the end of the calendar year. Works for me.

I purchased a subscription to QuickBooks Self-Employed, and used my personal bank acct to accept income and my personal visa to pay for expenses. Later in the year, I got smarter and opened a business checking acct (and a couple savings) and a business visa.

Now I have my own projects (billing time and materials) and decided to upgrade to QuickBooks Online Essentials.

My bookkeeping for 2021 is up to date in the new software, as well as the portion of 2020 where I was using my new accounts.

Here is where I need help: I want to enter my earlier 2020 income and expenses (the ones that were in my personal accounts) into my QuickBooks online software, but I don't think I should be linking my personal bank account to QuickBooks and including it in my bookkeeping from here out. What's the best way to go about it?

Can I just enter my income and expenses, and leave out all of my personal transactions? 

How will that reconcile and what QuickBooks accounts should I use?",1,1610808398.0,2021,2021-01-16,,lloydmercy,1,kyk4up
Can it ever make sense to buy a home instead of paying off debt?,"I am have been thinking about buying a house and what that will entail money wise for a while now. I have been using an app I found to calculate stress test affordability and payments, etc. I know what I'd like to spend on a house - way lower than I would be approved for - and even with some debt I could still get a big enough mortage to buy what I want. 

My thought process behind possibliy not paying off the debt faster and just saving and buying a house is that the money for the debt payment comes from my monthly fun money. The object that has a loan is one of my main hobbies so I would likely spend that money on the hobby or another one anyways.

In this case where the debt doesn't prevent me from getting a big enough mortage and the loan payment money comes from my fun/hobby money, can it make sense to buy a house while not paying off the debt any faster?",23,1610808046.0,2021,2021-01-16,Housing,jsdfkljdsafdsu980p,4,kyk1ge

Investing Path,"After years of shunning the market after 2008 put the fear of God into my parents (and me by proxy), I have decided to start investing. My view of money has always been one of fear and the pursuit of safety, so excuse me as I crawl out from under this rock.

Using this ([https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/money-steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/money-steps)) as a rough template, here is what I have.

**Budget**

I have three mortgages, all on condos in my city. Very hands off affair, which I like. I live in one. Total cost for me is 1000 dollars a month for utilities, taxes and mortgage. No car loan, or consumer debt to speak of. My job puts me reasonably middle class and my monthly budget allows me to save.  


**Emergency Fund**

I have a sizable emergency fund sitting in a cash GIC, which can cover 6 months of bad news. I also have a pension plan matched by my employer, which is automatically contributed to out of my pay. I also have 30k contributed to an RRSP, so my retirement fund is not something I am immediately concerned with.   


I am 30 living in Ontario, married (she doesn't work), which inevitably comes with expenses, however I am confident that my basic finances are solid.  


**Where to next?**

I have about 15k to distribute through the market. After reading through the subs, Value of Simple and CCP, I feel confident putting 35-45% of this into a TFSA, split between TD and RBC, both of whom I currently bank with. Utilizing TD e-series mutual funds and ishares ETFs  through RBC, I intended to DRIP and hold these funds for the long term.

This is the point where I get hit with the information paralysis. The more I read, the more I become convinced that there is something that I don't know or understand, which leaves me looking at MERs for a few hours and ultimately doing nothing.

Granted, I know I am overly conservative out of fear of ignorance. I want to compliment my real-estate holdings with reasonable, long term investments, which (I hope) will help me develop the confidence and knowledge to become a more hands on investor in the future.   


I still feel like I am missing something. What Next?",13,1610806427.0,2021,2021-01-16,,attackratiooutput,0,kyjmb0

NEW PR CONFUSED ON TAX OBLIGATIONS FOR 2020,"TL:DR  Spent 14 days in Canada as a PR in 2020 and want to know if i am obligated to file and pay tax on income previously taxed by home country.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will appreciate any advice i can get as i am completely confused at the moment and also unable to reach any CRA agents on the phone.

I landed as a PR in Feb 2020 and stayed in Canada (an AirBnB) for exactly 14 days after. In that 14 days, I open accounts with 2 banks and deposited my proof of funds, got a Canadian sim and a credit card which I only used for paying to keep my Canadian line active every 3 months.

Then I went back to my country on the 14th day and stayed the rest of the year in my country after which I returned to Canada on the 31st of Dec 2020. 

Of note is the fact that I continued my work in my home country, payed taxes to my home country till Dec 31st from my income, kept  my residence and payed my rents as they became due and kept all ties to my home country active.

What is the tax obligation of my situation and am I required to file taxes for 2020 in Canada?",29,1610804197.0,2021,2021-01-16,,CalloTinto,0,kyj1pd

"I'm 23, my new years resolution was to start investing. Need some guidance.","I'll start of with the important information:

I am a recent engineering graduate, and have landed a (pretty decent) job.

I have not contributed anything towards TFSA or RRSP.

My monthly income is roughly 5 digits (gross, I live in Alberta so about 7k net). I have an upper limit of around 100k total to invest atm. I am also debt free. I figure its kind of a shame for it all to be sitting there doing nothing. And somethings probably better than nothing.

No one in my family knows too much about it and there is a lot of information online that pull you either which way so it becomes hard to make an informed decision.

I'm more so looking for a passive approach at first to get my feet wet. Should I just go talk to my bank? I know they offer some kind of investing assistance services. I am also assuming they take a cut of some sort.

I'm trying to strike a balance between maximizing ROI and minimizing hands-on-ness if that makes sense. As per some random people's suggestion, I could dump a decent amount of money into like VUN and sit on it or something.

This probably sounds incredibly naive and frankly a bit lost but its a decent bit of money and I dont wanna blow it all doing stupid shit.

Much of the investment things are more targeted at USA and its respective citizens, I am assuming there is a fair bit of difference as a Canadian.

Cancelling lost in mail by Purolator Tangerine bank draft,"I’m with Tangerine and due to COVID all their branches are closed, I needed to get a bank draft to put down as a deposit for an apartment I’m purchasing. So they said the only way was by mail.

I’ve already contacted Purolator and they’ve opened up a trace to try and find my mail, but have no time estimates on how long the search could take or if it’s lost. So potentially that bank draft is just gone.

I contacted Tangerine but they said that I have to have the bank draft in hand for them to cancel it. Is this true?

Emergency fund- do i really need that much?,"I am still fairly new to all things budget, investing and quite frankly financial literacy. I saw a lot of recommendations about having an emergency fund  totaling 3-6 months of salary and it blows my mind. I find it an enormous amount of money to be set aside in a HYSA or a low risk investing account: I would much rather have say 5k in emergency fund and invest all the extra money. 

I am a almost 30 YO, have a common in law, no kids but a house, a car (paid) and a cat (super cute). I have a bank margin at 3% that I can use if I ever need it for personal stuff (can put 40k on it) and another margin for the house (was included in the deal for the mortgage, the amount we can put on it is what we have reimbursed on the house so far, so rn about 80k and increasing). On top of that, we have special accounts/money already put aside for car reparations, cell/computer replacement and kitty emergencies. We also have job and invalidity insurances. 

I guess everybody has a different amount they feel comfortable with, but either mine is a lot lower than most people, either I am not too stressed because if I fall back on something, it's a margin at 3% and not a credit card at 19%. Or maybe I am missing something important? Any constructive comment is truly appreciated :)

Want to understand if I over-contributed to my RRSP or not,"Hi everyone,

I came to Canada in Oct 2019, so for Taxation year 2019, I had 0 RRSP contribution limit. Now that I've filed 2019 taxes, I know that my RRSP contribution limit for 2020 is $6306.

I wasn't aware that RRSP period is from March - Feb instead of Jan - Dec. So, I started contributing to my employer RRSP (with matching DPSP contribution from my employer). Starting from Jan 2020 to Dec 2020, I contributed almost $6000 (with my employer matching the same DPSP contribution).

Now, as I checked my tax receipts, I see:

Jan - Feb 2020 RRSP contribution is $780

March - Dec 2020 RRSP contribution is $5200

Now, since I knew that my contribution room for next year would be roughly $20,000, I opened an RRSP account in Jan 2021 and contributed $6000. Again, since I didn't know that RRSP period is different than tax year, would you guys please let me know if I have already over-contributed?

So, from my understanding now, for tax year 2020, I haven't really over-contributed (since my contribution room is $6306, which is greater than $5980 that I can claim deduction for in year 2020). My understanding is that DPSP contribution reduces the RRSP contribution room for the following year, so for 2020, I should be good?

And, the contribution of $6000 that I made in Jan 2021 can be used for RRSP contribution for 2021? Do I need to declare it while filing taxes for 2020?

Forced into being a landlord - Tips? Naborly? Simplekey? Rent Guarantee?,"I have been forced into being a landlord to at least attempt to recover some of the money I have spent as a guarantor of a condo that defaulted. The property will not sell for anywhere near what is owed (some of the comparable properties are 1+ years on the market already) so I am having to rent it out for a bit. The property is in Alberta and in the same city as myself.

I am tempted to get a management company, however the cut they seem to want (10% + a bunch of yearly fees) will cost me even more money out of pocket as there is no way the rent itself will come close to covering the monthly expenses. Does anyone have experience with them? And if I were to consider them anything to look for?

Everyone talks about just doing it yourself. Are there any resources to help educate me more on what my rights are? What I need to do for a tenant? Templates for lease agreements? Things I need to write in (example: regular inspections)?

&#x200B;

And I have seen other rental properties mention ""check via Naborly"" and that had me searching. It seems two of the big tenant screening tools are Naborly and Simplekey. For 5% of your rent, Simplekey will apparently offer a rent guarantee (to pay your lost rent and also up to $10K in damages) if you get a bad tenant. On the surface that seems awesome but I feel like there must be a bunch of catches. What are your thoughts on these tools? Experiences?

Interac e-Transfer took money from account but didn't deposit it to other account,"Hello PFC,

I requested money via interac from my TD account. Completed the transfer in TD (the max amount was withdrawn from the account). The money still didn't get to my Scotiabank account.

I did another transfer the next day (for a smaller amount). It's already in Scotiabank.

How long should I wait for the other transfer to complete? If it doesn't go through, who do I need to contact? TD? Interac? Scotiabank?

If you had similar experiences and have advice I'd be grateful. (any links/numbers for support are also highly appreciated).

Cash down amount vs Investing,"Hi,

I am about to buy a 150k house and I have a few questions about the cash down. I currently have enought money to give 20% (30k) on the house. I am not sure if it is better to put 30k on the house or put 7,5k ( 5% cash down) and invest the rest into a S&P 500 Index that will give me about 7-8% every year. 

&#x200B;

 According to my calculations, my investment will be worth about 100k in 25 years. The difference the final price of the house would be about 33k if I only give 5% cash on it. So about 65k more money if I give 5% cash and invest 22,5k into the market.

The Costs and Causes of High Housing Prices,"I had a post downvoted to hell for stating some basic economic principles in a thread earlier, so I just wanted to start a discussion about some basic stuff and my opinion on it and see how people feel about it.

**Rent and purchase prices for homes are too high**.  Absolutely they are.  But many people in this forum framed that as ""landlords are too greedy"" and when I disagreed, I got tons of downvotes.

The **purchase price and rent of a home is not ""set"" by the seller or landlord arbitrarily**.  It may seem that way to a renter, but in reality they don't have that much power.  The actual rent or purchase price is a complex interplay of the demand for a home and the desire of a landlord to make a profit.  In markets where demand falls, landlords find they have inventory on the market for a long time and are forced to lower prices.  This may make the rental unprofitable and they may even sell the property at a discount to get it off their hands.  Demand for housing is inelastic, but demand for ANY GIVEN HOUSE is not.  If there are more than one property available, you always have the choice to go to another.

A good indication that prices are ""fair"" according to the market is how quickly a place gets rented.  If places get snapped up in hours and/or there are bidding wars on places, it means that the price **may actually be set too low**.   This seems to be the case in Toronto, both for purchase prices and rental prices in general.

BUT, you say **""I really want a cheaper house!  The median family is screwed!"".**  Absolutely, but let's actually talk about why that is.  Here's a number of factors that drive prices up in a neighborhood or city.  We will actually use the classical economic model of supply and demand.  It's very apt for this and explains a lot.

**When supply is below demand, prices rise.  When supply is above demand, prices fall.**

**Local Demand**

The GTA is large and has a lot of traffic.  Living near businesses (often downtown) and transit (often subway) drives local demand up.  Living anywhere in the Golden Horseshoe is a less local and less strong component of that.  Per acre or sqft, Kingston will be cheaper than Oshawa, which will be cheaper than Ajax, which is cheaper than East York, which is cheaper than Rosedale.

Schools are another huge driver of local demand.  Like many places, Toronto has a wide variety of school quality and living in a neighbourhood with ""good"" schools and other community features drives prices up significantly (sometimes as much as 50% for a place like Leaside in Toronto).

**Regional Demand**

Toronto and surrounding areas are growing faster than any other city in N America.  This is largely due to immigration.  While this policy is set at a national level, over 80% of immigrants land in the GTA and GVA, dramatically impacting population growth in these cities and driving a rise in the demand for housing.  

The availability of credit also increases demand. A drop in interest rates means that **the interest payments on a $1m mortgage is ""only"" $2200/mo**.  Contrast that to 1989 when a $2200/mo (inflation adjusted to $1100/mo) mortgage would only buy you $95k worth of house at then current interest rates around 14%.  

***By this measure, housing isn't actually that much more expensive on a monthly debt-service basis.  The real challenge today is that it takes 5 years of salary to save for a down payment on a $1m house, while a $95k house probably only took 6 months of salary to save a down payment in 1989.***

Beyond that, the number of dual income households has gone way up and with a constrained supply on housing, those dual income households bidding on scarce desirable housing will significantly bud up prices so that they start to reflect the income of two people rather than a single income. 

&#x200B;

**Supply** 

There are a number of things that drive limits supply, both on a global (entire region) and a local (neighbourhood) level.  Local limitations are a little obvious, but I'll mention them anyway.  Toronto is bound by the lake on one side, cutting the supply within a set distance of downtown in half compared to a comparable landlocked city.  Vancouver suffers a similar fate, but worse, as it's bound on multiple sides by water and mountains and even the US border.

Within the urban expanse, and outside the core, a significant fraction of the land is used for single family housing.  This presets a hard limit on the number of families that can live in these desirable areas. Again, using the example of Rosedale.  There are only about 3,000 homes in this highly desirable area.  That will always drive the price up, as the price will basically always reflect what the wealthiest 3,000 families are willing to pay at a given time.

Zoning regulations and development restrictions place a strong negative pressure on supply.  In a balanced market, as many new homes would be built as there were new families entering the area.  Density would increase to accommodate limited land as it would become more economical to build up over existing lots.

In 2019, there were **75,000 families net inflow in to Toronto** (the city itself only not the GTA) and only 25,000 new houses built (almost entirely condos).  This put a shockingly high pressure on rents and purchase prices.

But challenging zoning and restrictions on development, as well as good old NIMBY restrictions on ""character neighbourhoods"" restrict the density of most new units except in specific areas, where developers then resort to ultra-density high-rises where 1br units are the norm due to the economies of scale and the demand character for high-rise living.

&#x200B;

**Anti-Solutions**

Things that likely make the problem worse include:

1) Strict zoning regulations. These protect existing homeowners at the expense of new homeowners and arrivals.  They may protect the ""character"" of the city as Boomers remember it, but at the expense of people trying to buy now.

2) Regulatory red tape.  Building height, character, and land use restrictions seem to impact the ability of developers to build new properties and often new buildings are stuck in land-use committees for years before building, dramatically increasing the costs to construct new units.

3) Tax advantages for homeowners.  This seems to drive up the cost of housing due to speculation and makes renting less desirable.  These taxes are regressive at their base because they reward larger home purchases and punish those who rent or have very small/cheap houses.

4) Rent controls.  This (like other things above) protects the people who are currently in housing, while driving up rents for new starts and new rental agreements.  This favors the tenant being ""stuck"" in housing instead of being mobile or able to move, which is one of the reasons that people rent in the first place.

**Solutions**

1) Streamline the development of higher density housing.  Issue blanket zoning edicts that all neighbourhoods have to accept certain types of medium-density housing starts such as townhouses and mid-rise buildings.  A thousand new mid-rise townhouses in established neighbourhoods would sell well, and would also drive prices down (or at least slow their growth) in these areas.

2) Increased incentives to build larger (family friendly) housing in mid and high-density housing.  Right now high-rises tend to be small units because families don't usually choose high-rise life on major urban intersections.  But a well appointed, mid-density developments (8 plex, etc) within established neighbourhoods would provide options for families outside of single family homes without straining infrastructure

3) Scale back tax breaks for owner-occupied homeowners.  Again, do this gradually so that granny isn't priced out of her own house, but ensure that they reach parity with renting. 

4) Limit immigration or geographically target the residence of immigrants for a period of time to help reduce the burden on Toronto and Vancouver (and to a lesser degree Montreal).

Edit:

5) consider taxing or banning foreign speculation in the market for non-residents.  This may not be a huge impact but may have some effect.

Use money from HISA or use RRSP/HBP to buy a house ?,"Hi !

I'm new to investing/saving so this might be a noob question. Couldn't find anything in the search tho !

I currently have 5% of a downpayment in a HISA, and another 5% in a RRSP.

**Should I use the RRSP, or should I use the HISA ?**

My thinking goes like this :

* If I use the HISA, then I can't use the RRSP if I want to do renovations down the road, or to pay some extra furniture, and such
* If I use the RRSP with HBP, then I have to had ANOTHER payment on top of house, taxes, insurances, etc.

All this brings me to a second question : **If I go the RRSP way following question 1, should I put all my HISA in a RRSP just before income taxes, to get a bigger return, before using it for the house ?** (It won't be maxed out)

Closed Mortgage lump sum versus accelerated payments,"Hey guys we just bought a condo and we are shopping for mortgage. We are looking at TD variable rate mortgage.we got a variable rate of 1.4% (td prime - 1.2)% , monthly compounding, with the ability to make lump sum prepayments up to 15% of borrowed amount every year and / or make accelerated payments up to 100% of monthly payments.

I read somewhere on rates.ca that lump sum payment amount directly applies to the principal lowering the ongoing interest costs almost immediately. Whereas, it was not very clear in case of the accelerated payments if the “accelerated” payment portion would be applied entirely towards the principal ?

If this indeed is the case,  does it make sense to do only lump sum payments as soon as savings permit and stick to monthly payments or would accelerated payments be better with reference to total interest cost due for the amortization term ?

Without sounding obvious, we wanted to pay as less overall interest as possible :- )

How to Maximize my Money for Tax Season... New to all of this!,"Hi all,

I have more so recently started to think about how I can make my money grow a bit more... Bit of backstory of my career and financials:

I have now been working for an employee owned company for the past 7 years and have been purchasing shares through deals my employer has set up with the Canadian banks. I recently consolidated my loans with CIBC for a few reasons.... better rates for example... Prime + 0.5% as opposed to 1% and their amortization period is 10 vs 7 years. So I now hold about a $60k loan with CIBC for my purchased shares... very low risk and the return is exceptional.

Now... I get one dividend payment per year... usually a month or so prior to having to pay said loan above. Now, the dividends are not taxed - thus I save 30% to be safe for the following years taxes. I have invested that 30% the past year in a GIC as usually the money just sat in a very low % savings account... but I am curious to know what some other options are?

Here's what my plan was for this year:

\- Save $3,000 into a RRSP to offset my taxes (just deductions from my weekly pays)

\- Dividend payout... pay loan to CIBC, save 30% and grow that money in 14ish months before 2022 taxes and use the remaining money for my own use... currently doing some renovations etc...

Now with the 30% remaining which equates to approx... $9,000... I wanted to put this into a Tax-Free Investment Fund Account with Tangerine @ the Balanced Portfolio level. This was in hopes to maybe make 4-6% in lieu of the 1% of a GIC for example.

With that growing over the 14 months... I would have +/- $9,500... I typically wouldn't pay close to that in taxes... and would throw the remaining balance back into my RRSP. Rinse and repeat yearly.

I guess what I am really trying to understand is... what is my best investment option for a 14ish month period? My appetite for risk is not huge... as I still need to be able to fund paying off my taxes.

Thoughts? And thank you in advance!",5,1610746149.0,2021,2021-01-15,,bdt_hamTC,0,ky4cio

To give a bit of context me and my wife purchased our first home in Toronto (condo townhouse). We are both 26, household income is 150K. In 5 years we anticipate household income closer to 200K.

Currently we have 20% equity in the home and it is worth about $750K. The remaining cash we have is 60K in equities, and 10K cash for emergency fund. Interest rate on the mortgage is 1.6% with 25 yr am.

In 5 years we want children and a bigger home for a family. Does it make sense to re-finance and use the equity in our current home for the new home? The current home we're in would be a great rental. This is something we are considering in the future and nobody knows what interest rates will be then, but I definitely want to consider it.

I have a high risk tolerance overall but do not really know much about real estate investing. Would we use a second mortgage for the next primary residence? Would it be a HELOC or interest-only HELOC?

I recently started a new job for a start up based out of India.  I am part of the first set of hires in North america, and they are incorporated in the US.  I live in Toronto, but they are currently not fully incorporated in Canada, and have chosen for the time being to have us registered as contractors, and are being paid the entirety of our salary + commission in USD.  There are two main concerns for which I was hoping to get some advice. 

Conversion - I currently have a US savings account set up with RBC.  After speaking with my FA at RBC she basically told me the more money you are converting, the better the rate, but I don't plan on waiting 8-9 months to convert the cash into CAD for expenses/investments etc.  Does anybody have any other reliable suggestions for minimizing my cost for conversion? 

Tax implications - I will not have any tax deductions from my salary.  My entire gross salary plus commission will be deposited into this USD savings account monthly.  Right now my HISA is 1% i believe, and short term GICs are really shit, both in the US and CA (like 90 day .24% shit) The idea that Im just sitting on this cash, or a conservative portion of it before tax time making no interest seems like a lost opportunity, but don't really know where else I can park that money?  I was told set up quarterly payments to CRA and then figure out the difference at the end of the year, which seems like a decent idea, but was wondering if there were any other creative ways I could SAFELY keep this money so its not collecting pretty shit interest until I pay tax and can invest the difference.  I realize this may not be possible but thought I'd crowd source some ideas from this wonderful community. 

Any and all advice is welcome and appreciated guys!!! Thanks so much!",1,1610741648.0,2021,2021-01-15,Employment,tayims,0,ky2s77

Wealth Simple Trade Funding From Joint Account,"I recently set up a Wealth Simple Trade TFSA account for my wife.

Instant Pot: has it actually saved you money?,"Despite my best efforts - shopping at Walmart and Costco, eating mostly vegetarian, big-batch cooking - I find that I still spend more on groceries per-person than most others in Ottawa seem to. I could probably make better use of sales but I'm definitely a ""cook what I'm craving"" type person. I'm hoping to bring my grocery costs down, and I've heard that the Instant Pot is really great for that. But I'm a little bit skeptical, and I haven't seen much discussion about it on this sub. 

There's no doubt that dry beans are cheaper than canned beans, for example, but my skeptic brain wonders how many cans of $0.79 Great Value beans you need to circumvent to make up for the Instant Pot's $120 pricetag. It seems like a long climb uphill. Similarly, I've heard that it saves money on electricity, but according to the Hydro Ottawa app I only use $11 per month on cooking anyway, and most of that is probably baking.

RBC WestJet RBC World Elite Mastercard for student. Thoughts?,"Hey guys. Currently with RBC and have Signature RBC Rewards Visa with no annual fee since I'm a student. I'm going abroad for post grad in the UK and was looking at getting WestJet RBC World Elite Mastercard.

I know the first time I travel I'll be taking 2 with me for sure.. Does it seem worthy for a student and with the travelling I will be doing? West Jet has direct flights to where I will be going so my reason for looking at the card.

I know the card has a $60,000 income required, so I was hoping for a family member to apply and I would go under it with additional card, or some way like that? or joint account..(any suggestions would be amazing!). Would this be worth it or should I just stick with the credit card I have rn? My family members would as well use the card to visit me, go on travels, etc, so hopefully the annual fee would be worth it.

Interest rates are practically as low as they go and stocks just took the biggest tumble they have since 2008. When interest rates rise, bond values will fall, and when stocks values rise bond values usually fall.

No debt (paid off my student loan during first lockdown!)

TD1X appears to be the right form, but does anyone know how the form is actually implemented from a Payroll perspective?  If you claim 100k Gross commissions and $50k expenses on the form, will the employer just assume you will make $50k gross for the year and tax you based on that level?

Credit Card Repayment: Help with three options,"Hello everyone,   


I am looking for some help with repaying my credit card. I have proposed three different methods of paying  back my debt, but I was looking for some further insight from this sub as I have learned much from it & it has helped me become a more financially conscious person.   


Backstory:   
Racked up credit card debt through idiotic spending. Defaulted on a credit card through Desjardin and ended up with an R9 on my record. After speaking with a financial advisor I ended up realizing how stupid I was thinking that I could outrun the creditors & ended up paying off the credit balance with Desjardin.   


I now have one outstanding balance with TD and I'm looking to minimize the interest that I will have to pay. I am currently not eligible for a TFSA with TD (credit is too low & R9 just got removed from report) so I am unable to access a lower interest rate through there.   


I have two accounts on Wealthsimple. One with their robo-advisor and one on their trade platform. My only problem is that they are my only form of savings & I just built up my 3 month safety net. I believe that I am comfortable with parting with the robo-advisor account and keeping the trade account active as I am having decent returns. Here is some more info:   


Robo-advisor:   
\- 6.9% time weighted return  
\- 3.3% simple return  
\- $1650 value

Trade:  
\- 64% 3-month return   
\- $1450 value  


I have the three following propositions for paying back my credit card:   


Method 1:   
\- Approximately 11 months payback period   
\- Paying $400/mo   
\- Approximate interest: $373 (I have both cash advance at 22.99% and purchases at 19.99%)  


Method 2:  
\- Approximately 3 months payback period  
\- Paying $3100 lump sum (both trade and robo-advisor accounts) & $400/mo afterwards   
\- Approximate interest: $83

  
Method 3:  
\- Approximately 7 months payback period   
\- Paying $1650 lump sum (just robo-advisor account) & $400/mo afterwards  
\- Approximate interest: $191.99  


 This is where I am stuck. I cannot decide on which option to take, on the one hand I would like to get this debt paid off ASAP, but on the other hand I value my accounts and the safety net that they provide.   


Any information of any type is welcome. I know I was frivolous with my finances and I am learning as I go. I'm just glad that this sub has allowed me to understand my finances better and make informed decisions.

\- Simply transfer USD to CAD. This will incur exchange rates and CAD is going strong at present.

\- Buy  vanguard US offered ETFs example: VTI. And keep it under USD TFSA.

In future, I just want to keep investing simple and just invest in all in one ETF like VGRO as I know I wont be able to monitor investments every week and my hold time is >10-15 years.",5,1610726884.0,2021,2021-01-15,,CanadaBuyer,0,kxxjq1
Can I merge my Mortgage & Heloc Payments during renewal?,"Hello,

"First-Time Homebuyer, giving up","So I've followed this sub-reddit for a while.  I followed lots of advice and took my credit score from the low 500's to 720+ in a relatively short period of time.  I changed jobs and went from 50K a year to 60K.  I also qualified for my county's down-payment assistance program.  It basically provides a 10% loan for a down payment that is forgiven if you remain in the home you buy with it for 20 years.  Everything was looking up for buying my first home.  After renting a small apartment for $2000 a month, I would finally be able to put that into my own equity.

&#x200B;

I received my pre-qualification and it was for a purchase price of $300K.  That's where everything fell apart.  There are ZERO homes in my county for that amount.  None.  And this isn't the GTA or any major city.  It's central Ontario.  The cheapest I've seen in the past 6 months is $340,000 and any in that range typically go above asking and sell within days, not to mention look rundown and are in the sketchiest of neighbourhoods.  I'm not even that picky, I'll like in sketchville if it means I get to own my own home.  I can't even find a realtor that will respond because I qualify for so little.  Most of them just tell me I'll never find anything in this area for that little. 

&#x200B;

Paying as much as I do in rent, I'll never amass $80K for a 20% down-payment so I can bypass CMHC, so I'm officially stuck and throwing in the towel.  Housing is unaffordable even in regions that don't have much going for it.  I have no idea what I can do at this point.  I did what I could, and it seems each time I get close someone pulls the carrot a little further away.  Let this be a cautionary tale to those much younger.  Learn to manage your money and save save save as soon as you're out and on your own otherwise you'll end up in this sort of situation which, I'm not gonna lie, is getting mighty depressing.

"""borrowing"" from spouse to max out RRSP?","Throwaway account, obvs. 

My spouse and I split our shared expenses 50/50, each putting the same amount into a joint bank account every month. 
Our pre-tax salaries are similar, but I'm paying into a pension and they have employee shares maturing regularly. As a result, they have a lot more cash flow than I do. 

Assuming they have maxed out their RRSP and TFSA, and I've maxed out my TFSA, I feel like the next place to divert excess cash would be my RRSP (rather than a taxable account) 

As I said, we split our expenses equally. But if, for example, we decided on a 60/40 split of expenses, I could fund my RRSP. 

For the sake of equality, we like the even split. So the other idea I have is creating a new RRSP in my name, but my spouse's excess cash would fund it and we'd both know it. Yes, I'd get the tax refund now, which I actually care less about than just having the $ invested in what I understand is a more straightforward vehicle than a taxable account? 

I believe that contributing to your spouses RRSP hits your contribution limit, but I don't quite understand why, or if that's relevant in this case. 

TL;DR what's to stop me from ""borrowing"" for my RRSP from my spouse, at a 0% rate? 😏",7,1610711483.0,2021,2021-01-15,,Dizzy_Criticism2503,0,kxt1se

Recent Graduate - Looking for advice on a better credit card and savings account,"Hi all! So I just finished university at the end of December and I realized my student card is going to expire in about a month. I'd like to switch to a card with better benefits if possible, but I don't really know where to start. 

**Current Credit Card**: 

* I'm currently banking with RBC and I have a student card that earns 1% cashback on everything with a $1000 limit (I have never tried raising my limit because I like that having a low limit forces me to pay it off frequently so I never miss a payment by mistake). 
* I'm an international student waiting for my Post Graduate Work Permit to be processed so I'm not sure if that will affect my options. 
*  I have a good credit score but only about 5 years of credit history.
*  Do you guys recommend sticking with cashback cards or do you get more with rewards points? 

**Current Savings Accounts:** 

* I'm  currently using RBC's Find&Save savings account that auto deposits money from my chequing account. I like that it automatically deposits money for me so I've been able to set aside money over the last couple of years without really putting any thought into it, but it only earns 0.05% interest. Is this a pretty standard interest rate or should I be looking for something better?  
* I also have an RBC High Interest eSavings account but as it actually has the same interest rate as the Find&Save account (0.05%) I don't keep any money in that account. 

Any advice on these matters or any other financial matters I should be considering would be very much appreciated! :)",6,1610696652.0,2021,2021-01-15,,94books,1,kxpu0o

What would you do? $1.5 Million in Toronto...,"First of all, burner account. Not looking for attention, just serious advice... Also, please be patient - this is a long one.

My wife and I (and dog) live in a condo-townhouse in Toronto. A developer has offered to buy our entire lot, which required votes from all owners, etc. and long story short... it appears that we're selling everything, and I will end up with $1.5 Million - for a place that was probably worth $750,000 on its own.

So - I have $240,000 left on my mortgage (at 3.4% - for another 2.5 years). I have no other ""bad"" debts to speak off. My wife and I both make decent money, but are far more concerned with a good lifestyle/travel/experience vs. career ambition. Our combined annual income is around $130,000. We have around $350,000 in savings/investments.

Assuming the sale goes through... what would you do? Options include -

1. Pay off mortgage, buy a house with $1.25 M - or less - invest the rest

1a) Don't pay off mortgage, buy with $1.25 M - invest the other $240K profiting from cheap mortgage rates.

2) Keep mortgage, buy a bigger house with $1.5 M

3) Pay of mortgage - rent a cool apartment/house - invest $1.25 M

4) Pay of mortgage - rent a cool place - and buy a place or two (out of Toronto) for $400,000ish each - and rent them out as income properties. Invest the rest...

5) Any other combination of the above... or anything else?

If you're buying something - what/where are you buying. I will not buy a condo in Toronto (condo fees/taxes are terrible)- somewhere else - sure.If you're investing - what are you buying? Stocks, funds, crypto?

I'll be honest, depending on the day - I flip flop between various combinations of all these options. We know that we're suddenly in great shape, and we're now looking at how to maximize this opportunity. We are both in our late 30's, willing to work as much as is necessary, but also looking forward to relaxing/travelling when we can... and potentially retiring young (if we make good choices!). Also - we'd prefer to continue living in Toronto, but have also considered moving out of town - but that would require new jobs etc.

I deposited 4K + 1K CAD and bought some stocks. Seemed pretty straightforward. Apparently I was borrowing money to buy them and it wasn't using the funds I deposited, so I have 5K CAD sitting in the account doing nothing. 

To fix this I assume I should convert my CAD to USD (apparently [Norbert's Gambit](https://wealthsavvy.ca/norberts-gambit-questrade/) is the best way to do this) and then Questrade will automatically take the money I owe in USD from my cash balance? Or I could sell my stocks (but I don't want to). Is it that easy?

While writing this I kinda figured it out while researching but figured I'd still post so you can laugh at me for making this common mistake and maybe clarify anything that's wrong. Thanks",4,1610685348.0,2021,2021-01-14,Investing,GiveMeTheFagioli,0,kxn3dc
How does one invest monthly in stocks?,"So two months ago I got wealthsimple, initially put in 200, put my money into a few stocks I felt were safe (actually got 8% growth in December!), and another 100$ this month, got some efts and some more shares of stocks I already have. 
I'm planning on putting in 100$ a month but don't really know what I'm supposed to do. Do I keep buying shares of stocks I already have, or do I keep adding new stocks to my stock collection (I know its called a portfolio) LOL. Or should I just leave it as is and just let the stocks do their thing? 
I'm a stock market newbie so just looking for some feedback on how to best utilize this resource for long term growth. 
I understand the point of buying stocks when they're down and not panicking and selling them if they go down (sell high). 
Any feedback is truly appreciated. Thank you in advance! ☺",5,1610685269.0,2021,2021-01-14,Investing,soyycratess,0,kxn2ms

How to invest/put money to make more money?,"Hi,

So with such a crazy year, Im just wanting to learn on how to invest/put money into other things that will make more money? But have no clue where to start, so I wanted to ask this sub. Im thinking to start with like $<1k and grow from there? But honestly would like to learn more, as so many people seem to be investing. 

What are the most secure options? HISA isnt really an option for me btw, plus HISA is pretty useless at the moment anyway.

Toyota Rav4 2019 - Lease vs Finance - need suggestions.,"Hey All,

I am looking for suggestions regarding Toyota Rav4 XLE 2019 model which I leased on June 2019 from a dealer in Montreal, QC.

While leasing, dealer told me that this car will be leased under Toyota financials and the interest is 6%. I did not had the choice at the moment so I took it.

After paying for 1.5 years, I have realized that 6% is huge and there is no real alternative for this lease. Recently, I called dealership and they suggested to get pre-approval from bank and buy(finance) the car.

I can even pay off my car but financial gurus suggest the opposite. So I put money in RRSP/TFSA instead as it wasn't even close to 50% to its' limits.

So what should I do here? should I go ahead and finance this car? I have 'Very Good' credit score and have no loans.

Thanks",16,1610684328.0,2021,2021-01-14,Auto,hsharpreet,0,kxmtb5
"The real reason why people are able to afford large mortgages: joint mortgage/ownership and ""straw buyers""","I expect to be downvoted to hell for this, but let's be very clear: I am obviously **not** a real estate investor. But, I have been asked to act as a ""joint owner"" in a strange real estate deal. Here is how it works (it sounds eerily like straw buying):

So, my sister makes some $63k a year (healthcare, non-management, unionized with a pension--even though it is thought to be defined contribution). She wants to buy a condo for investment purposes (as a rental, that is). Unfortunately, despite having that kind of income and a high (I believe to be 800s) credit score, there is no way to just buy a $600k condo in Toronto (and I mean downtown Toronto, in the heart of the financial district) with just 20% down (that is all that she has in the bank I believe)--that is to say, no bank will approve her for a $480k mortgage on a $63k salary even if her job is so secure, that she can't lose it unless she did something terribly wrong. That is true even though she owes $0 debt currently.

So, she came up with this scheme: knowing that I make around $45k a year (and have no debt to my name either), she figures ""well, we can tell the bank that we make $108k and are applying for a $480k loan, if we can stretch the mortgage out to 30 years"". Given that I too have a 800+ credit score, it is entirely probable that this mortgage would be approved. All of the income we are speaking of is legitimate and reported on T4s from our respective jobs (I have been with my company for more than 3 years while she has been with hers for almost 3 years).

The reason why she thinks this works, is that in theory, she can rent this kind of place to someone for $2100, and so she can easily absorb the $400-500 of negative cash flow per month on her income alone (property tax + condo fees add up to about $500 a month I heard). So, while I am not *de facto* liable for the mortgage payments, I will *de jure* be liable. Plus, the kind of place that she is considering buying is literally a shoebox in the sky (think 500 square feet micro condos) that almost no one other than single people and couples without kids will rent, and so high turnover will likely mean that she can constantly raise her rent (as soon as the previous tenant moves out, if the market rate is higher than what they had been paying, the next tenant will pay more, etc...).

Her plan, she tells me, is to hold this property for 10 years or more, renting it out the entire time. If there is enough equity built up, she could take out an HELOC to act as a down payment for another property (I don't exactly know how this is going to work or if the bank will deny these as risky loans), or simply sell the condo if it becomes profitable to do so.

I had actually warned her of the dangers (not in a legal sense, but financially). I told her: with COVID-19 and every central bank printing money left, right and center and every central government handing out stimulus money (a la CERB) like nothing before (the ""money printing go brr"" meme is definitely rooted in reality), you can watch inflation (and therefore interest rates) shoot up to the sky. So while we may be able to get 2.4% APR locked in for 10 years, it may skyrocket up to 5% or 6% (even though $20 minimum wage will probably be the reality by that time). Her argument is ""well, if that is the case, rent would just keep going up, right?"" To which I don't have an answer.

So, I finally understand how average people can afford to buy a lot of homes, even in absence of foreign money or inheritances. Because while 1 person making $50k is middle class, if 4 people, each of whom make $50k, live together and pool their money to buy real estate, they would look like upper class (rich) people. Even if it's just 2 people, it makes mortgages a lot easier to get.",18,1610684101.0,2021,2021-01-14,Housing,random20190826,0,kxmqzm

Finance advice - TFSAs and investments/down payment,"Hi,

I'm looking for some advice as to how I should proceed in terms of moving my TFSA amounts as well as potential future investments/down payment.

I initially opened up a TD TFSA account but have realized I have not been actively trading in it. I saw that EQ offers a TFSA account with a high interest rate and thought I should move  my amounts from TD to EQ. I have already sold all my stocks, so I am just currently sitting on cash. 

Would moving all my cash from the TD TFSA be the best move? I would like to still look to learn more about stocks and do some trading but I'm not sure if the EQ account allows for that? If that's the case should I leave my TD TFSA open or are there other alternatives?

&#x200B;

I am also currently in the mindset of saving up for a down payment for a place but I do not really have a timeframe for that... Due to covid I have been fortunate enough to move back home with my parents  so my expenses have been very low and I've been able to save a bit.

If I don't have a timeframe for purchasing a home would it still be in my best interest to place all my savings into a HISA from EQ or into EQ's TFSA?

I currently have the following numbers:

\-salary 50k  
\-TD TFSA 10k  
\-EQ HISA 10k

Also is there a point in which I should stop putting my savings for a down payment in a HISA and instead invest it? I can see that can be quite a vague question due to housing being vastly different but would I aim for potentially 20% and once I've met that then try to use my savings elsewhere?

Help me help my aging father?,"So my father left our town in AB close to 10 years ago since he had to retire due to medical stuff and couldn't afford to stay in Canada. He has a small pension and has been bouncing around doing the expat thing, Thailand, Philippines, etc to make his dollars stretch and get by. Normally he just does a visa run to exit and re-enter the country, but at the moment the Philippines isn't planning on letting anyone back in because of the Rona. 

Just found out his visa runs out in March, and I don't think he has a plan. I live with my partner and kiddos in small apartment barely big enough for us and can't take him in, not to mention the 2 week quarantine that we couldn't help him with, nor can we do much to help financially without going into debt.

Ex-husband left with car debt,"throwaway account...

Could this debt go to my friend? (Has it already?)

I’m using Questrade TFSA to invest since RBC has high fees. I’m also going to move the 2.5k I have in my RBC TFSA into my Questrade TFSA (right now it’s currently not invested). I might also invest a small amount into individual stocks since we are in lockdown and the market will be dropping. 

     I’ve heard a lot about VFV.TO so I’m thinking of investing into that. My friend is invested in VOO which I have also heard about. 

     My question is, is there one ETF that is “best”? Or are they all pretty much the same more or less? I will be keeping the money in there anywhere from 5-10 years (I don’t need the money, so if I’m 5 years the market goes up maybe I’ll take it out, if not I’ll just let it sit).

Credit Karma Canada - arbitrary geolocation restriction,"So I am from Ontario, paying taxes in Quebec, but physically outside Canada.  Normally I spend time in Canada as well, but due to covid all of my colleagues left the country and I have agreed to be here to maintain presence.  I started having a problem accessing CreditKarma.ca in June.  I recently filed a support request and after much back and forth, they sent this;

""Thank you for confirming your mailing address and that you're not physically in Canada. Allow me to mention that Credit Karma Canada App and website only work in Canadian territory. That's because you can't access your account.""

The above is their poorly written response to why I can't log in.  This restriction is not in their terms.  There is no reference to needing to be PHYSICALLY in Canada to access the site (or app).  

Is anyone able to access their app or site from outside Canada?  I have been unable to access it since June.  They are now claiming that it is because I am not inside Canada.  Even if I connect to my work or personal (nord) VPN so that I appear as coming from Canada the site will not let me log in.  

As if their acquisition by Intuit didn't already make them look bad, now they're randomly enforcing a geolocation access restriction.  They even sent me an email about how my score has changed since I last accessed it in June...  When i wasn't in Canada at all in 2020 due to Covid.

My thanks to the CRA - got a big refund through Taxpayer Relief,"Back in 2004 I decided to go back to university for another science degree (biology). For some reason I forgot to submit my T2202 forms for the tuition and textbook refund.

Totally by accident I discovered my mistake a few months ago. I contacted the university to send me the T2202 forms for the period 2004 to 2011 (the degree took a long time because I did it part time while I was working).

Then I called CRA to see what to do. The person I spoke to was super helpful, explained what to do, and emailed me all the forms I needed to fill out. He also said to send a cover letter explaining what happened and asking for Taxpayer Relief because they only have to go back 3 years.

A few months later they sent me my tax refund for the full amount - over $4000. They didn't have to, but they went back 16 years to amend my tax returns.

No one likes to pay taxes, but I've never had a bad experience with the CRA. Thanks.

RESP for CAN PR/US Citizen?,"When my wife and I first moved to Canada, we were told that RESPs were a bad idea due to burdensome IRS requirements. I recently saw (https://www.moodystax.com/reporting-relief-for-us-citizens-residing-in-canada/) that the IRS issued a memo (Revenue Procedure 2020-17) that excludes many people from reporting requirements for RESPs. This seems like it's opened the door to RESPs for US citizens and made them feasible. 

My question is this: am I understanding this right? Was the reporting requirement the only real barrier to RESPs? Are there other hurdles that I'm missing that would still make RESPs unattractive?

My wife and I currently have one child who is a dual CAN/US citizen and we have another child on the way. We'd really like to start saving for their eventual education and it'd be great if we could use the RESP to do it.

Should I be purchasing/selling US securities in a US Holdings account vs a CDN Holdings account?,"Hey everyone!

Just curious about buying US securities in my Canadian Holdings account. Are there fees embedded in the exchange rate that I am charged if I buy a US security and then sell that same US security if its in Canadian denominated funds? I have a direct investing account through RBC.

I am wondering if I am better off making a one time transfer of funds to my US Holdings account before making purchases and sales in US denominations. My thinking on this is that I would only be charged the embedded exchange fee once on my transfer of CDN $ over to US and once again whenever I inevitably transfer those US $ back to CDN. This would contrast (if my thinking is correct) with continually purchasing and selling US securities in my CDN account where I would be charged the embedded exchange fee on every single purchase from CDN to US and sale from US to CDN.

Simple example would be having $100 in my Canadian Holdings and purchasing and immediately selling a US security 20 times. Ignoring the typical sales commission of $9.95 or whatever it is, I expect that $100 to be whittled away by the exchange fees back and forth between CDN/US $. Whereas if I transfer that $100 to my US account, I would have a US $ value equal to say $98 CDN after the exchange fee is taken, and I then emulate the same process of purchasing and immediately selling a US security 20 times. Once again, ignoring the $9.95 commission, I wouldn't actually lose anything on exchange commissions because every trade is happening in US $.

I hope I articulated my question substantially enough.

TLDR;

Am I better off trading US securities in a US Holdings account and vice versa.

Finances & Investing options as a government employee," Hey guys,

Just a little background info:  I joined the military when I was 17 and am now 22. My university education was paid for through the military and I am now graduating with a degree and no student debt. As part of my contract, I have to work for 5 years in the military as an officer. Salary ranges from \~60k starting to \~80k in 3-5 years.

As a military member and government employee, My finances are a little  different from the general public. I have job security and a constant paycheck. This gives me a little more financial freedom than  a lot of civie jobs. Some of the financial advice I’ve been going  through doesn’t seem to apply IMO.

For example, keeping at least 3-6 months’ worth of wages/emergency fund in  the case of job loss or any unforeseen circumstances. Keeping an  emergency fund is beneficial but the opportunity cost of not investing  that money for the future is high… especially since I know I'll be paid next paycheck.

If my car  breaks down and needs a substantial amount of repair, I can use a low interest line of credit to cover it. I’ll still be paying less in interest than I would have (potentially) earned from investing that same  amount of money.

With that in mind,

1. Would you recommend keeping a sizeable emergency fund rather than investing it in low-medium risk options?
2. After serving 25 years, the military offers 50% of your highest income as pension until death. IMO, it doesn’t make sense  to contribute extra to an RRSP or the like. Would you recommend doing it regardless?
3. I've saved up enough these past 5 years to put a 15% down payment on a house in the GTA. Would you recommend using that money to buy myself a house? As a military member I'll be changing locations across Canada every 2 years... so I won't be using that house. At the same time, housing provided by the military is extremely cheap. I can rent out and use that for the mortgage. My end goal is to be living in the GTA.

* $9,000 owed on CC #1 (over the limit by $500) — 24.99% interest
* $7,000 owed on CC #2 (exactly at limit) — 19.95% interest
* $550 owed on CC #3 (exactly at limit) — 24.99% interest
* $15,000 remaining on my student loans — 4.5% interest
* $700 overdraft on old checking account
* $850 owed on kitchen appliances payment

**Current assets:**

* None.

**A little info for context:**

* I was put on medical leave of absence from work Jan 2019 and then let go from my company for ""job abandonment"" — despite the insurance company recognizing my medical issue (this matter is being reviewed by the Labour department and a legal clinic)
* Due to above medical issue, I've spent the past 2 years in and out of the hospital for weeks at a time making it really difficult to secure a new job
* Secured a new job in March 2020 and was then let go 3 days before my start date due to the company's response to COVID
* Been on CERB/CRB ever since
* Was already in a financial mess prior to all this and was on my way to resolving it before my medical leave of absence  
 

**Present day:**

* I'm doing much better medically and have been applying/interviewing for new jobs (had 2 very promising interviews for one role — keeping my fingers crossed for it!)
* I'm collecting CRB in the meantime — which is just enough to cover rent, utilities, limited groceries, and half of my prescriptions (even with Trillium drug benefits)
* An INCREDIBLY generous relative has offered to help me out and is willing to provide me with a 'family loan' of $10k to help me out  
 

**WHERE YOU CAN HELP**

I'm looking for advice on how to best allocate this $10k. Do I pay off one CC fully, do I pay off a heavy chunk of a few, etc.

My mention of the medical issue isn't a pity party or an excuse. It was for context since it's but me out of commission even before — and during — COVID.

I recognize that I've dealt with this ***really*** poorly over the years and spent a lot of time reflecting on it while laying down in the hospital. I don't want to stay in this situation any longer and I recognize that I need help to be as responsible as possible with this unbelievable gift of $10k.

Have any of you been in similar situations and gotten out of it? Does anyone have experience/knowledge on what my next best steps are?

Please help — and if you have any advice on books/courses to get better educated on my own financial literacy, please advise.

Thank you so much in advance. I'm really hoping that Reddit can do it's thing here!",7,1610650105.0,2021,2021-01-14,Debt,ThrowAway2784802,0,kxbxcu
OMERS buyback worth it?,"Anyone have experience with buying back OMERS and how this has affected your retirement? 

I’m currently looking to buy back 19 months of service for $18,663. The cheapest monthly payment is 36 months for $566...which is quite a bit. I don’t have an RRSP. 

Somehow this only results in $91.58 in additional annual pension per month of service (which means only $91 more per year?!). 

Is it worth it for me to buy back? I’m 23, looking to retire early (minimum is 30 years of service) so that would be 53. If I buy back then I can retire at 51.

"Comfortably buy a Strata Townhome, or Stretch for Freehold Townhome?","Hello All,

I've been house hunting and right now I have two options for the price ranges I am looking at (ON):

1. Freehold townhouse, no condo fees, 2 bedrooms, 1250 square feet, Likely around $460-470k. I will be poor as dirt if I buy. Will owe the parents 30-40k from this. Has a garage, but no basement, no backyard.

2. Strata townhouse, $360/month condo fee cover snow, roof, pavement, water, 1700 square feet, 3 bedrooms, $340-350k. Easily afford. Owe the parents nothing. Will have some 30k cash left over. No garage, has basement and backyard.

The first option would leave me with pretty much nothing left, maximum mortgage possible, as well as owing the parents a good chunk of money for their contribution. However, the house is much more modern. It's a newer 2000s build and I am less worried about any issues with maintenance.  The appreciation will also be far greater than the strata.

The second option is a solid strata townhome and from what I have seen, the board runs a tight ship. However, it would appreciate less and the housing stock is a bit older (1980s). The second option would leave me with a very comfortable $20-30k in cash left over, as well as a much smaller mortgage.

I currently make in the mid 60k range. This is expected to increase to mid 70k by end of this year, and then 90k by 3 years.

T2200 + Employer indicating it's not neccesary.,"So, I've actually worked from home for a decent period of time now (2+ years) however never bothered to deal w/ a t2200 as I've roomed with other people. However, I moved this year and within my work @ home agreement it explicitly states I need an office space that needs to be unoccupied by others while I work(Meaning, it's only used for work). This necessitates me renting a unit larger than I normally would. When I reached out to my employer for the form they initially indicated the GOV did not deem it necessary because we didn't ""meet clients at our home"". I waited about a week, and emailed them back specifically asking if this was actually messaging from the government, or if they deemed it wasn't needed themselves. I actually didn't get an answer, and she responded with an email to the whole office indicating we were not going to issue t2200's as we can claim up to 400$ on our returns without one. 

&#x200B;

I have an issue with this. A) This 400$ does not equate to even a quarter of my claims I could make. And B) This is indicating to me that my employer is aware that there are work related expenses and are refusing to issue the form for what appears to potentially be invalid reasons. I've emailed back stating this, and didn't receive a response for about a month. At this point I'm getting my tax forms all together, and I'm planning on filing without the T2200 and if audited / pushed providing this context and email chain directly to the CRA. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Am I legally able to do this ? Am I missing something here or ? Am I being too much of a dick, or is my HR actually trying to dick people around ? My natural response at this point is to almost inform my co-workers of all of this - and ensure they are aware they can take advantage of these forms and should be pushing HR to issue them(Which at the end of the day, is going to be more work than just issuing mine). I genuinely believe I have a very legitimate claim to the tax write offs, I'm paying nearly 500$ / month more than I would be for a unit I need to have this office space - and this year in particular working at home isn't a choice. I moved during the pandemic and had to keep this in mind when renting.",23,1610645726.0,2021,2021-01-14,Taxes,dotdotca,1,kxae04

Should I just move over all of it so I have more to play with? I’ve considered the mutual fund more as my safe bet, low risk investment. Should I keep it as is and continue contributing to it? Or just contribute to my investing RSP exclusively so I can build that up as well?

My liquid cash position isn’t overly strong for another 2-3 years due to debt repayment but I could potentially get access to some inheritance money early and pull out a small amount ongoing (a portion of interest dividends I’m thinking) to invest long term. 

I know next to nothing about the mechanics of doing this but I feel strongly about the industry’s potential, so where would you advise I go to learn about how to actually start the process? I’ll be speaking with a bank advisor at some point as this would be pulling from an existing family account but would love advice on online resources I could consult and learn from to turn this into a bit of an invisible ongoing investment, something that could be either ongoing and automatic or managed by someone else for a few.

Is it a good idea to plan for buying a home this year?,"Hello,

I am looking for some advice on potentially purchasing a home. I've tried to get some advice scrolling through this sub/old posts however I feel vastly different than everyone else posting (everyone seems to have it so together, no debt and high savings and income... makes me feel slightly discouraged tbh.)

Some back information about me: I am 30, I live in Calgary. My income is $82K, I have about $25K of debt ($18K in my LOC (stupid mistakes in my past years) and $7K in student loans). I expect to have this debt paid off by November hopefully. I currently am fortunate enough to be living rent-free with family so I can chip away at my debt and save. I have roughly $30K saved in RRSPs which I plan to use a portion of towards a home. I have very small savings besides that, only about $4K in cash.

I am looking around the $300K range for a townhome, something I will be able to live in happily for a while. Being a 30 year old adult, I cannot imagine living with family much longer, although I am extremely grateful for how much it's helped me out. I want to purchase a house by the end of the year, but the thought of it gives me anxiety. I don't think I will be able to save up 20% down anytime soon, so I am thinking I would have to go the 5% down route and suck up having CMHC fees. 

I guess my question is, given all of my information above, does that seem feasible for me? I am quite a risk-averse person by nature, so the thought of having all of my money/assets tied into a home stresses me out, however I know I can't live in my situation much longer. I also personally don't feel like I should be renting if I could just purchase a home and put into my own equity. 

I was NEVER money-savvy growing up and neither was my family (I came from a family with a lot of financial issues around debt and over spending) so I am really trying to do this the right away and set myself up properly.

Him: I (believe) he makes about $26k per year. However, he also receives commission so his salary is probably increased by a bit.

Landlord Selling 3BR Townhouse in Pandemic - Don't Want to Move,"Hi PFCCanada,

Longtime user, throwaway here. LOCATION - North of Toronto

So, my wife and I found out yesterday that our landlord plans to sell the 3BR Townhouse in the GTA we are renting (after 2 years of leasing, we are currently on month to month).

Obviously it’s quite upsetting to us we are in the middle of a pandemic with fresh “stay at home” orders, as well as 2 kids including a 3 week old… All we know is that the landlord plans to sell in the Spring, we don’t know exactly when yet or obviously what the intentions of the new owner will be.

I’ve already called the LTB and they were helpful in confirming what I already understood, but I’m posting here for some further discussion or help.

I am not interested in being a prick and refusing to leave, it’s not the type of person I am. But I’m upset that we are being asked to move in the pandemic considering we will be asked to allow COUNTLESS total strangers into our home, while at the same time, risking my own family by going to view other people’s houses at the same time. **How is this safe? How is this legal in a pandemic?**

And to make things worse, GTA Suburbs have gone up in Selling and Rental Price because of the WFH flight out of the core, so now a comparable townhouse has gone up like $400-$700! What the fuck, it’s like double, triple whammy.

The LTB made it clear to me, that if I can’t find a house to move too, then I can simply stay and let the LTB make a decision. But my wife and I don’t enjoy living in a situation like that with uncertainty hanging over our family’s head.

The only option I can think of is asking the landlord to reconsidering selling until the pandemic is over or nearly finished. We are thinking of committing to a full year lease (we’ll need to at another place anyway) as some sort of financial certainty incase that makes a difference to him.

Has anyone gone through this during the pandemic? The LTB obviously were reluctant to tell me what to do, but I figured I’d ask here for any advice and I say that loosely because I know this is legal and needs proper legal advice.",15,1610635103.0,2021,2021-01-14,,PFCcan_taway987,0,kx6tt0

Inquiry Regarding Pension,"Hey!

I recently read the following regarding pension in Quebec:

&#x200B;

""If you file an Application for a Retirement Pension at age 65, the [amount of your retirement pension](https://www.rrq.gouv.qc.ca/en/retraite/rrq/calcul_rente/Pages/montant_rr.aspx) will replace between 25% to 33.33% of the average monthly earnings on which you contributed to the Plan. That rate varies based on the number of years during which you contributed to the additional plan, which was introduced following the [enhancement to the Québec Pension Plan](https://www.rrq.gouv.qc.ca/en/programmes/regime_rentes/bonification/Pages/bonification-du-rrq.aspx) in 2019. **Also, the maximum monthly retirement pension is $1208.26 in 2021**. If you are under age 65, you will receive a reduced pension for the duration of your retirement. Conversely, your pension will be greater if you begin receiving it after age 65. ""

&#x200B;

In my current Job I contribute about 360 dollars every two weeks to pension and my work matches that contribution actually. 

  
Which means I am contributing 1440 to my pension every month. But reading the following makes me seem like I wont ever actually get that much back? 

&#x200B;

Assuming I stay at my work my whole life will they just pay me 1208.26? Not even the 1440 I actually pay in, without even any interest? 

&#x200B;

I realize I am 30 years from retirement and inflation and all that, but still seems off.

&#x200B;

Should I stop contributing so much?",3,1610633261.0,2021,2021-01-14,,pitchko,2,kx6a0m

Help regarding options trading,"I have an existing TFSA account with Questrade and have contribution room for this year and wanted to try trading options. I did some research and looks like IB is a better service than Questrade when trading options. However when trying to sign up via IB, it has two options for setting up my account which is margin vs cash. 

My questions are:

* I wanted to understand the difference between the margin account option across these two platforms 
* With IB it says I can open a cash account and trade options as well or is margin really the only way? 
* To trade options, it make sense to do it in a non-TFSA account so the losses don't eat up your ocntribution room? 
* Lastly, the IB questionnaire is very clear in their requirements when it comes to networth and net income, is everyone lying?

I have two more semesters left, so I’m done end of summer. I currently have a job that pays me $27.30/hour for one client & another $31.25/hour for another. I work about 33.5 hours a week & make enough to cover everything with just some leftover. I’m not working 40 so that I can focus on school too. The problem is that I feel like I’m suffering.

Any insight about taxes irt crypto is appreciated,"I've been spending the better part of this week reading forums, tax sites, and CRA about tax rules, but I was hoping someone can clarify on a few things. 

Please let me know if I'm wrong about any of these:

-When I started in Dec 2017, I was trading daily and when it crashed I stopped trading and hodl. I invested a few times a year until Sept 2020, when I cashed out some Ether for the first time, and have since been trading several times a month, and have cashed out and bought back a handful of times. I claim partly as capital gains and partly as business income, since my hodls are investments but my quick trades are business income. I do not report the expenses incurred to buy back ETH until I dispose of it. 

-I keep a detailed Excel spreadsheet of all my transactions including: transfers between Coinbase and Binance, coin-to-coin conversion, and fundings/withdrawals. I know CRA states that ""there could be tax consequences when you do [aforementioned transactions]"", however because I was hodling, I had not yet ultimately realized gains/income so therefore I did not include it in my previous tax returns. I understand that those transactions count as selling/income and buying/expense but if they want to audit 5 pages of strings of numbers to prove that net income of each of those transactions was null, they can. 

So here's where I can't find specific info anywhere: 

I bought crypto over time with different prices in different quantities, and I did not sell in matching quantities, nor did I sell it entirely before repurchasing. How do I calculate what my profits are? Do I average my buy price over time? Or do I use the price from of my first transaction?",6,1610603055.0,2021,2021-01-14,,_feelslikesummer,0,kwzhu2

Vehicle Allowance vs Company Vehicle worth calculation,"I've been struggling to figure this out for a few years and still can't figure out an answer.

At our company I can either take an $800/mth vehicle allowance and allow me to charge all my fuel (personal or business) to the company.  Maintenance and insurance are paid for by myself.

OR 

The company will lease a vehicle and give that to me.  Same deal with the gas, however insurance and maintenance are paid for by the company.

Buy our dream house now or later?,"My [27F] SO [30M] and I are currently in the process of buying a house and are debating whether or not we should buy a nicer house now or to wait until later. The original plan was to look for a house in the $1-$1.5 million range and then to roll it up into something else within 5 years. We had a conversation about this over the last week and wonder if it’s better to stretch our budget now than to deal with realtor fees/ land transfer tax in the future. We currently live in downtown Toronto at a condo that I own and my SO does not own any property. We will not be selling my condo for the downpayment as my SO works out of his office sometimes between 6:30 am - 5 pm and having the condo for the weekdays would save us commuting headaches. We are thinking about having kids in the near term but it won’t be for another 2-3 years at minimum. 



STATS 
HH Income - roughly $630,000 (both of us are in finance) and a large chunk of it comes at the end of the year through bonuses. Roughly 25% are deferred shares. My SO was recently promoted so his salary will be bumped by another $50,000 this coming year. 


Downpayment - we were thinking about putting down $275,000 but we can stretch it to $600,000 without depleting our savings 


Debt - SO and I both lease our cars. The leases comes up to about $1500 per month for both cars plus about $220 insurance. Currently owe about $330,000 on the condo I own. Market value on this condo is roughly $850,000 (2BR/2 WR with parking in DT Toronto). Monthly payments come up to $2200 including maintenance and taxes. 


The house - 20% down on a $1.5 million would come up to about $4100-$4300 per month for the mortgage or about $50,000 per year in after tax income. 20% down on a $2.5 million home would come up to roughly $6900 per month or about $82,800 per year in after tax income. 


We have already talked to the bank about the mortgage situation and they have approved us for both scenarios. We are just debating whether or not we should buy what we want now or to wait for another 5 years. TIA!",6,1610602180.0,2021,2021-01-14,Housing,schiesu,0,kwz9wm

2. Portion of property tax be written off as it is an expense for the mortgage helper

Issues with NSLSC and RAP,"This post is long so sorry in advance! Just wanting to get some insight to see if anyone else is dealing with this issue currently...

TL;DR getting screwed over by the NSLSC band Tricura Canada and they've ruined my credit.

I graduated in 2016 and have been on $0 payments with RAP since then. I applied again as usual in October and they wanted proof of income. Fair enough, except they requested October paystubs, which happened to be a 3 pay month. I was concerned so I sent in my September and October statements, along with a letter explaining the situation just in case (via mail, fax and online). 

Mid November I get a notification that my RAP application is incomplete.. I go look and it says I haven't submitted proof of income. So I upload all of the documents again. A few days later, I check and it still says the same thing. So I decided to call and talk to someone. Took forever to get through to anyone, but the representative that I spoke with assured me that the documents were uploaded and they're just behind in processing applications due to the volume. Fair enough.

December rolls around and I get a new notification that my RAP application is incomplete and about to expire. It now shows an overdue payment as well. So I call again but am directed to Tricura. The person I spoke with seemed annoyed that I was calling since I had spoken with someone a month previously, however she assured me that everything was fine and they're just backed up. Also said I would not be penalized for being overdue on this payment.

December 30th or 31st (can't remember exactly) comes and I have notice that my RAP has been approved, however not for $0 payments. I will have to pay $115/month. I wasn't sure if that included my Federal and Provincial loans, but found out January 7th that it was only the Federal portion. I had an email from Alberta Student Aid that I was approved for RAP but would have to pay $200/month.

$315 per month is a lot of money, however I can make that work. My issue is that they both state that I am now 2 months behind in payments. I called the NSLSC again and was directed to Tricura. I spoke with an individual named Tom and honestly he was NO help. He gave me no real reason as to why I'm on the hook for November and December payments when I legitimately did not know I would have to pay for those months since I wasn't notified into end of December and beginning of January. He mentioned that my credit score could be affected by not paying... And then proceeded to tell me I could wait until April and just pay everything at once in the event that I come into a large sum of money. WTF? He then told me that there were others who were worse off than me because they still haven't been notified if their RAP has been approved so they would actually be overdue by 3 or 4 months, as if that's supposed to make me feel better. I've recently learned that these loans are now affecting my credit score and it has plummeted 70 points.

I honestly feel like this is super unethical. I understand that I have to pay my loans back. I'm not contesting that at all but you'd think that they could take into account this whole pandemic and the financial strain that a lot of people are dealing with and just move those 2 payments to the end of the term or something. 

Am hoping for some insight or advice on how to handle this. I'm having no luck getting through to anyone at the NSLSC specifically but am planning on writing a letter and sending it. I'm mostly just upset because I do not have an extra $600 to pay these overdue payments.

- I plan on renting out the other two rooms but not sure how quick that can happen or how much I would get given covid (location isn’t downtown, about 35 min by bus)
- I’m single and my gross income is 71k. I net about $1900 every other week
- of course I still need to factor in 3k property tax and home insurance and internet which aren’t included.

"Condo inspection, is it a must?","Hey, first home buyer here!

The place I bought is 677 sqft condo unit in downtown Toronto. The building is 3 years old. My real estate agent suggested not to hire a home inspector since the building is so new. I think that's reasonable but wanted to see everyone's thoughts here.

Thanks.

Edit: Sorry I should have clarified, I bought the place and have 3 weeks until closing date. I believe we have 2 times to enter the unit till then. We are visiting the place to see if anything needs to be fixed.

Should I be buying a new car?,"Hey guys,

I’ve been racking my brain these last few days on what to do. I figure if I can’t figure it out, a bunch of strangers on the internet must be able to.

Situation: I am 29, making about 50k a year. My girlfriend makes about 35-40k. We have around 40k in savings and hope to buy a home in the next 2 years.

We have a 6 year old and a baby on the way, We’ve decided last minute that we need an suv. We have 2 large dogs, soon to be 2 kids, and a 2 door civic.

I have been weighing the options between new and used cars, I have narrowed it down to a new Hyundai Tucson for 30k (0% interest). The other option is to buy a used suv (10-15k), but after interest rates and taxes it starts to add up.

I’m hesitant on buying anything cheaper, thinking about safety for the kids, and the reliability. I’m just looking for some input to see what people think. 

I hope that’s enough information to work off, thanks!",7,1610597603.0,2021,2021-01-13,,jrumor,0,kwy27t

Where would you buy a house in Canada?,"I keep saving money and the house prices in Ontario keep going up, so today I was thinking that maybe moving to another province could be a good option.  


I make $110k and I work 100% remote. I don't have any family in Canada and quite frankly I also don't have many friends. I have $90k saved which I could use on a downpayment if I move to another province.  


The question is... where?  
Would it be a smart decision to buy something around $450k? (20% downpayment is what I currently have). The mortgage would be a lot cheaper than my current rent ($1500 vs $2300). Or maybe I should keep saving or investing?  


To be honest, the only thing that keeps me in Ontario these days is the fact that I don't know Canada this much and I'm afraid that other places will be way too cold.",249,1610597064.0,2021,2021-01-13,,SomeFunnyNick,71,kwxwj4

"TFSA WealthSimple, QuestTrade, EQ or other?","Hello PFC, I'm making a post on behalf of my cousin who isn't as familiar with reddit but would love some advice.

She's 24yo and she's accumulated some money she can put away/invest. She's never opened a TFSA and within the next year and I think she wants to put 2k in it immediately, and add about another 3-5k by the end of the year. She doesn't know who to go with and she's scared of hidden management fees/etc involved, or who gives the best rates. I suggested WS or QT (based on reviews I've had with coworkers) so that way she can get a start on understanding her investments and she's seen some good reviews from both and as well EQ bank.

Tax effect of rental property operating at a cash flow deficit,"Hi PFC, my spouse and I own a condo that we rent out in downtown Toronto. Due to covid and work from home, rental rates are way down in the core and as a result we find ourselves in a cash flow deficit (rent: $2,850/mo, mortgage: $3,150/mo, condo fees: $740/mo, property taxes: $325/mo —> resulting in monthly deficit of $1,365 and annual deficit of $16,380).

For tax purposes, would my annual income be reduced by $16,380 plus any other condo-related expenses?

Is there any way to reflect that the deficit is being being covered on our part with after-tax dollars?

Resolving Phone Bill Change,"Hey guys! I appreciate in advance any help with my issue. Please let me know if any problems with my post. 

Recently, about a month ago, I upgraded my cell plan and phone with a provider in Ontario (live in southwest Ontario). I got a pretty good deal on a plan and negotiated to pay the vast majority of my phone device off up front. I was promised certain fees being waived and also a reimbursement for some tax I would have paid. These charges were promptly deposited as credit to my account with the provider. 

I assumed (incorrectly) that because the negotiated charges I was to receive were deposited correctly and promptly, the rest of the agreement would be fine. 

Wrong

Now I know this is my fault, by I neglected to check the contract/bill until the day before the bill was due to be charged via direct deposit. The contract I received in the mail reflected absolutely none of the charges, plan, or phone deposit we negotiated. I immediately disabled the direct deposit. The phone help lone was down for the night but I tried contacting them via online chat that night. I probably talked to a robot but I have a copy of the chat. I just said my contract was not what I negotiated and had no intention of paying until it was fixed. I said I would call the next day (today) when they were open. 

So today I talked to a human and told them the situation. I have the numbers from the original negotiation and a name. But I know that’s not a lot. They said they would call me back working 10 days (lol). Mean while they have already withdrawn the incorrect amount from my account and the bill is paid. 

Now my question is, can I dispute this charge in any way? I never wanted to pay the charge as it seems like I’m agreeing to the new contract but I canceled the direct deposit too late for that to matter. Can I go to my bank? I made it very clear that I have no problem paying for a service, but this contract is not what I agreed to. Or can I trust the provider to exchange funds down the line to fix this? Is there any official way I can complain or do they just have me over a barrel because I technically already paid the bill? 

Thanks I’m advance and I hope y’all have some ideas.",0,1610591578.0,2021,2021-01-13,Misc,brwonmagikk,1,kwwapz
TD Direct Investing: Are Cash Accounts Necessary?,"Hey PFC! 

I finished up the ""Value of Simple"" today by John Robertson, and just had a quick question about his chapter on TD Direct Investing. My initial plan was to open just a TD Direct Investing TFSA in order to build my e-series portfolio; however, in the book, the author recommends that you open up a Cash account in addition to said TFSA. The reason he provided was that it could potentially prevent you from overcontributing; however, if I already track each of my contributions onto a spreadsheet, would the Cash account  be necessary- I currently have a TD Chequing account, so couldn't I just transfer funds over from there to my Direct Investing TFSA?  What benefits are there to having a Cash account as well?  

Side note- if any of you guys applied online to open up TD Direct Investing accounts, please feel free to shed light on approximately how long it took; I'd really appreciate the input.

Is bad customer service expected for cheap personal financial services in Canada?,"I am trying to answer the question whether it is worth to start using established services (like Big 5) and eat their maintenance fees instead of chasing discount/online firms that this subreddit often recommends.

RRSP HBP in current situation,"Hi fellow redditors!

We got our offer accepted on our first home last week! 

We will be putting in 20% downpayment (10% each). I can put in my share of the downpayment amount without using the RRSP homebuyers plan. However, I had set aside 35K in cash in the RRSP since the beginning of 2020 (talk about lost investment opportunities!) 

I'm not sure if it is a good idea to use the RRSP HBP or not.

1. My marginal tax rate is at 48.2%. It may decrease after a couple of years once I decide to move to a less demanding job. I will be maximising my RRSP contribution this year and next. 
2. I do not have any matching contribution from employer.

Opinions on investments vs investment property?,"Hey all, 

My wife and I (mid-30s) have been scratching our heads on what's our next step financially.  We have our house, she's on  mat leave until September and we are thinking about what to do with our bit of savings to have it grow. 

We recently saw a condo for sale near us that looks like a great rental opportunity. Its currently being rented, and has an in building super/maintenance person. 

Would it be wise to take our TFSA funds and use that for the down payment to get into this property, or would it be better to just hold off until we can just save for a down payment on a similar property? Ill post some numbers below...

&#x200B;

Condo Asking Price $185,000, monthly rent currently at $1200. Plus there is a $340 strata fee. 

Our current financial picture looks like this, 

$115,000 remaining on our Mortgage (We own half with my MIL. It will be fully ours at some point. Was purchased as a bank foreclosure for a decent price and currently assessed at $400,000)

I have $54,000 in a TFSA, my wife has around $10,000 in a TFSA

I have RRSP of $27,000 and have a company pension plan(15 years vested), she also has around $20,000 RRSP and a Pension plan, but only recently enrolled in it. 

Our only other debt at this time is a car loan with $10,000 remaining. We hope to pay this off in 2021 once my wife receives her top up from Mat leave in Sept. 

Only other caveat would be that I would like to move within the next 5 years. Perhaps build our dream home, but there is no real rush. We are in Halifax, NS and the market is booming here right now.",2,1610587498.0,2021,2021-01-13,Investing,LuigiCo83,0,kwv38q

Canada home buyer's plan help,"I haven't given this a tremendous amount of thought at the moment, but I want to make sure this is a sound plan because soon I will start saving for a home. I read that if you save $35000 in a TFSA you can withdraw this money for your first home.

Right now, as per the sub guidelines, I'm filling up my TFSA. When it comes time to save this $35000, I heard it's best to put it on your RRSP as a lump sum.

The way I see it, there are two ways to do this:

1. I could save the money little by little in a HISE and dump it onto the RRSP.
2. I could save the money little by little in my TFSA and invest in something like XGRO. When it's time, I could transfer this to my RRSP then withdraw it. I'm not concerned about XGRO. I realize the negative consequences of XGRO taking a downturn but there is also a possibility for growth while I'm waiting to purchase or build something.

Building a house - Small builder versus Large Builders?,"I'm in the process of looking at buying a home, and I'm looking at various options that are available.

I'm still struggling with deciding whether to build or buy new, as the prices in the local market seem to be comparable. 

One of the things that I've heard quite a bit about is being careful with the builder you choose. I've heard different things from different people though, where it sounds like large builders tend to cut corners and cut costs as much as possible to increase profit margins.

However, I'm not sure how reputable some of these smaller builders are with few reviews. I imagine they can dedicate more time and probably don't have as many projects to spread their efforts on. But I also imagine they have worse economies of scale and less capital if anything needs to be revised or fixed.

Does anyone have experience with building with a relatively new builder? How can you ensure your builders know what they're doing and will provide a quality product?

Also when buying new, should I be considering who the original builder was and asking questions about the original construction of the home? I imagine there's a chance the house was a lemon, and that is why it's being sold as well.

Thanks, would love any input that anyone has.",10,1610577714.0,2021,2021-01-13,,gcxedm,0,kwrx3n

The do-it-yourself google sheets budget tool.,"I posted a thread a year+ ago with a google sheets tool I use to track and manage my spending and net worth. I've had a few people message me privately saying that the old thread links are dead. And they are! Because I deleted them by accident. So I've recreated them, updated them, and I'll try to make sure they don't get removed again. So, onto the main post.  


Inspired by some other fellow Redditors I created a budget tool using google sheets and google forms. The reason this tool works for myself and others is that it forces you to manually input each expense you make. I think this is the best way to manage your money because it doesn't let you ""set-and-forget"" your spending and it keeps you consciously aware of your day to day spending. There are many other tools you can use. YNAB, MINT, your bank's shoddy spending trackers. But none of those gave me enough information or helped me be more aware in the way that inputting the information manually has. 

Using a google form, you can quickly input data on the go, from your phone or a computer, and have that data immediately available in your budget sheet. The tool sorts the raw data and feeds it back to you in monthly and yearly summaries. It is not perfect, and I'm always updating my own version but it's free and it works.  


Instructions:  
Open the Google Sheets and MAKE SURE you save a copy to your own private Google Drive. Follow through the brief notes page and set up your google forms sheet.

Play around with the Budget Form below to see how inputs work, and feel free to add expenses, etc to the sheet using the form.

It’s too tempting to move cash from HISA to investing?,"Hey all, 

Does anyone have this problem too? I’m relatively new to investing (been doing it 1.5yrs with a roboinvestor), and I’m finding it hard not to chip away at my HISA cash and put it into Investing. I’ve maxed my TFSA and RRSP, and am putting the rest in a unregistered account. 

I followed the steps to personal finances here, clearing debt etc and now growing my unregistered account is my new savings goal. But it’s growing so slowly.... 

I save well but it’s feel a slower year in terms of income this year so that doesn’t help. 

Also, my HISA is for funding a future house and for vacations, both of which are years away at least. I may not even want to get into the housing market again. It’s hard to just hold onto that cash and wait and see.  

Hope this makes sense! I just keep feeling like I “want to do something” with my HISA emergency fund/short term goals fund.. when I know I shouldn’t! Has anyone felt this way?",4,1610575975.0,2021,2021-01-13,,ComparisonLucky7228,1,kwrbqr

TFSA Question Norberts Gambit,"I just wanted to check to make sure that I will not be dinged for overcontribution to my TFSA through TD DI. When I opened my TFSA at TD I noticed that they actually opened 2 accounts for me, a CAD and a USD TFSA. These accounts have the same numbers and the only difference is the last letter (J and K). Are these treated as the same account by the CRA? i.e. If I buy DLR in my CAD TFSA, journal it over using their online securities transfer service, and then sell in my USD account, would that be considered as a withdrawal from my CAD account and recontribution to the USD account? Or are they considered the same account and it would be fine?

Quit Office Job for Freelance - Have Some RRSP Questions,"Hey there,
For some context in regards to my situation, I recently left my long time office job to try my hand at some part-time freelance work (among other things I've felt I needed to do in my life).
My wife has recently started working full-time and we'll be getting by (based on our bill history) on her income + whatever I can bring in w/ about 2 yrs of buffer (2yr buffer is assuming 0 income from me) via some built up savings for this time.
I've been fortunate enough to be surrounded by some smart and helpful people that have always encouraged me to try and maximize my RRSP contributions for the last few years, so have built up a decent chunk (150~) split between RRSP and DPSP.

Now that I have left my job, Sun Life has been emailing/voicemailing me frequently re: the time sensitive (by end of this month) options I have for keeping my money with them, and I've been putting off contacting them until I have a feel I have an idea of what I should be doing/ what my options are (I'm not incredibly savvy about this stuff... but am trying to learn more).

We don't have any current intentions to withdraw money from our retirement savings, but I wonder if we don't expect to be making any contributions to it for the next 2+ years (possibly more), what is a reasonable course of action? I will talk with Sun Life but I guess I just wanted to ask here first as I don't know my way around this stuff too well and I fully expect the company I talk to to fully just pitch for me to stay there.

Another thing I've heard from someone recently was that I should just look into hiring the services of a financial advisor, as they would help make sure we're putting things in the right place.
I'm open to this (but have no experience with them as of yet), but because we don't do anything too crazy with our money I like to think if I can just pick up a serviceable amount of knowledge re: these things I should be able to at least make sure we don't do anything too stupid?

Canadian citizen thinking of abroad retirement,"I'm in my mid-30's and have started taking a harder look at our finances and long term goals and thinking about retirement. 

We are in a bit of a unique position because my wife has 2 citizenships (Canadian/US) and her dad was born in Britain so she could get a UK passport as well. Currently we are in Toronto and expect to stay (at least in Canada) until our kids are sorted with University (20ish years from now).

The UK seems attractive to me, because housing costs are actually quite cheap if you are outside of London (currently in Toronto and would be fine retiring somewhere more quiet). CPP/OAS are transferrable and they have nationalized healthcare. The US would also be an option, but healthcare costs make it less attractive. 

Currently, only I have a TFSA (due to US citizenship) and we have work RRSPs and cpp/oas. Most of our assets are tied up in our home (we have a small detached house, in a gentrifying area of the city).

Does anyone have any experience with this? Are there any investment considerations we should be taking if we are considering retiring abroad?

How Risky is Having Savings in Equities for Short Term Investing,"Hi PFC,

My partner and I have around 140k saved and earn 140k between us. We are looking at buying something in the Toronto in the next few years. Both of us have our savings (outside of emergency funds) entirely in equities.

Yes, I know this goes against common advice around here, and that there is a chance it come back to burn us, but I have a hard time selling off investments and parking that money somewhere safer. Especially when housing prices are appreciating at the rate they are. Leaving our money in the market could cut off a year of saving over the next 3 years.

It wouldn't be the end of the world for us if the market took a downturn and we had to wait for 5 more years for it to rebound to avoid pulling our money out at a loss. Definitely a bummer, cause we want to start a family, but not the end of the world.

More often than not, this approach is going to have us come out on top.  The downside, is it might turn our buying timeline completely upside down.

US dollar TFSA at TD Investing,"Just on a call with TD who told me that CRA does not allow them to transfer US funds from my USD TD Bank account to the USD side of my TDI TFSA.  They proposed a very complicated process to get this done:  first, I'd have to open a TDI ""Cash"" account, which is a non-registered cash-investible trading account as opposed to a margin account, then buy a USD denominated money market security, then journal that security over to my TFSA, then sell the money market fund to get USD cash in the TFSA.  


TD claims this is required by CRA so TD can report a CAD value of the TFSA deposit using a verifiable reference, the money market security.  I asked why they couldn't just report it using the Bank of Canada USD-CAD exchange rate, but she said CRA doesn't allow this.

I find this hard to believe, given RBC seems to allow direct USD cash funding to the US side of their TFSA as answered [here](https://www6.royalbank.com/en/di/reference/article/tfsa-faqs/imt5qgzm).

Best way to increase credit score with no debts ?,"24 ; I'm not horrible with money per se, I'm just horrible with staying on top of things.

I've had some items in collections previously that I procrastinated on paying off. It was about 2K and $300. I paid off both these items last year and they are now. closed on my transunion report. I also had a defaulted student loan that was on my report before but since I ended up going back to finish school, the student loan went back to being active. (still shows history of defaulting though)

I just paid off my full student loan this year and I graduated last April.

My focus is now on how to best build up my credit score.

I officially have $0 in debt (yay) and I've had the capital one secured CC for about a year.

When I check my score through capital one it pulls from transunion and shows up at 650. When I check my score through borrowell I think it pulls from Equifax because that one shows up at around 548.

Would it be beneficial for me to apply for another CC whether secured or unsecured? Are there any cards that would accept me with my current credit score?

Why not use the Home Buyers Plan?,"So I'm looking at saving for a house in \~5 years.

Unless my math is way off, if I were to take out the full $35,000 from an RRSP to use the HBP then my payments over 15 years are a minimum of $2333 a year. Repayment of the HBP has a mandatory minimum so essentially I can pay $200 a month into my RRSP and designate it as my HBP repayment.

How is a $200 dollar a month (INTEREST FREE) investment for an extra $35,000 towards a home purchase not a great deal in any world where you're not a millionaire buying a house outright?

&#x200B;

I get that you lose any potential earnings from that $200 a month being invested, compound interest etc. But having a house now (or in \~5 years in my case) > having more money when I'm 60. I can see how this wouldn't be great if the HBP payments completely erase your RRSP contributions, but as long as you're still making contributions this is a no brainer right?

HISA and Emergency fund no longer relevant?,"I don't really post much and mostly lurk here but I have to ask.

Basically the outlook on the future is bleak for anyone saving for a house or basically saving in general if you don't already own a house or have lots of money to invest. 

The money steps say to have an emergency fund in cash or save for a downpayment in a HISA. 

This is no longer relevant it seems correct? If interest rates keep plunging which increases asset value and decreases cash value. It doesn't make any logical sense to have anything in cash.

I have money sitting in a HISA as an emergency fund/potential downpayment (basically just a pipe dream and irrelevant in some ways now) and in my chequeing.

This doesn't seem like this is the correct way anymore. It seems to me from reading this sub that this way of saving is now irrelevant and the only way is now putting everything into investing if i want to save for a downpayment or something like that. If housing is going up in value by 20% yoy and a HISA is only getting 1.5%. 

It seems to makes logical sense that every dollar not invested now is just wasted money even in a HISA.",22,1610562350.0,2021,2021-01-13,Investing,Sugrats,2,kwmidv
"TFSA Contribution Room & Transferring ""In Kind""","Hey PFC,

Looking for a little bit of help. I opened a Multi-Holding TFSA at TD in November to begin investing using the Canadian Couch Potato e-series portfolio; however, my dumbass actually purchased the i-series index funds instead of the e-series, which has a weighted MER of around 0.7% compared to the e-series' 0.4%. Moreover, the Multi-Holding TFSA can't hold the e-series. Anyways, I've got a bit of free time on my hands, and so I thought I would try and fix my mistake. 

After doing some digging online, I found out that I could open a TD Mutual Fund TFSA in order to hold the e-series; I plan to make an appointment and open the aforementioned account. However, this is where I'm a little confused. If I transfer my i-series funds from the Multi-Holding TFSA to the Mutual Fund TFSA ""in kind"", and then switch those funds over to their e-series versions, how would this impact my total TFSA contribution room? My understanding is that it shouldn't have any effect, but I'd appreciate your guys' input.

is whole life a good conservative investment?,"their is a financial sales person with no cfp telling me on facebook why whole life is a good investment

They claim in a participating policy the dividends are around 6% per year though not guaranteed but you are guaranteed not to lose money, the claim is that it is a very good conservative investment as most conservative portfolios pay 3 to 4 percent annually over a long period of time

claim is i can borrow against the cash value to access the money and still have coverage, if the dividends pay more then the interest on the loan it won't run out if done properly as tax free income

says it is another form of buy term and invest the difference

Would it be monumentally dumb to delay joining the pension for homeownership?,"Hi everyone,

I'm at a crossroads, where I can basically pick between pension and homeownership. I'm not sure which to pick.

I live in Ottawa, where housing prices are basically in clown town. [The average for all homes was 20% up YOY, and unlike Toronto and Vancouver, even condos are having double-digit increases here (15%).](https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/ottawa-home-prices-will-continue-to-skyrocket-in-2021-royal-lepage-1.5230718) I'm getting nervous about being priced out of the place where I have a good, stable job that I love, and one with good benefits/vacation/pension. I know how rare those can be.

I earn about $70k and I'll have a $100k down payment. From my calculations, this means I can afford a condo townhome or stacked condo in the $350k-$500k region. Closer to $500k would be squeaking it, but I'm ok with being temporarily ""house poor"", because in 1.5 years our household income will double; my husband will graduate from his comp sci program and will go from earning sporadic intern wages to a $50k-$65k. I would normally just wait the 1.5 years, but with projected figures, by then then the $450k townhouse will cost $600k or more (20% rise x 1.5yrs). Also: we probably won't qualify for any more mortgage in 2 years, because my husband will almost certainly be a contract worker. So it feels like we should just jump in now. Homeownership is really important to me, on a personal level; I've always bristled at having a landlord. I have an appointment with a mortgage broker later this month to find out the exact numbers.

Now, for the complication... As of this month, I'm eligible to join the defined-benefit pension plan at work. But my contributions would be $450 per month. That's STEEP, and I think it would kill the homeownership dream until my partner graduates. Would it be totally insane to put off joining the pension for 1.5 years until our cash flow increases, so that we can buy a home? The way I see it, the pension will always be there waiting for me to join, but the housing market in Ottawa won't be.",17,1610558336.0,2021,2021-01-13,Retirement,timhortonsbitchass,2,kwl122
Choosing between DB & DC pension,"Hello PFC,

Hoping someone here can help me understand my pension value / choose between DB & DC pension.

my company offers a fully funded core pension, with the below formula : 

1.3% of final average earnings up to YMPE (Multiplied by) years of service (minus) 1/2 of CPP benefit prorated to years of service

in addition to the core pension, the company lets me choose between either a Defined benefit contribution or a Defined benefit option

Defined benefit : i can contribute up to 4% of my salary above the YMPE, the company ""contributes as necessary"" (have no idea what this means) 

Defined contribution : i can contribute between 1% - 6% above YMPE, the company will match 75% of my contributions

Now i understand that a defined benefit is essentially guaranteed money, whereas with a defined contribution pension investing the money is my responsibility. However i don't think i have a good understanding of each option's value at retirement.

Salary is currently at $72K. Age is 28. Been with the company for 4 years now.

Which one should i choose ? is there a clear winner in terms of value & peace of mind ? does the better option depend on my salary or how long i stay with the company ? what factors should i include when choosing ?

I am 26 and finally starting my career after years of working menial jobs. I want to be financially secure but have no idea where to begin.,"Hey everyone, I am 26 and have finally secured a ""real"" job after months of applying and studying. I say real because this is my first office job (Software Development) and it feels like I've finally made it as an adult and have what looks to be the beginning of a career. No more burger flipping or dealing with drunk passengers if you know what I mean. 

The thing is, I have very little knowledge about personal finance. I have about $14k saved up, and will take home about $42k/annually after taxes from my new job. I currently live in Toronto with my parents, but my new job is in Ottawa. As a result, I am planning on renting a 1 bedroom as soon as possible.

I've never had to worry about rent, food, utilities, etc. But now it's time for me to spread my wings and become fully independent.  

So my main questions are:  

1. I've heard that it's best to not go over 30% of your monthly take-home on rent, so I assume $1050 is my budget. Is this model accurate for responsible housing? 

2. What should I be doing with my income to maximize its utility? I've never been a big spender. I have a TFSA that my dad created for me a few years ago. It takes $300/month from my bank account. My dad tried explaining it to me and I understand it as a way to invest in safe stocks for long term gains. I also have no debt. I've asked him about other tips but all he said was to save as much as I can.

3. My goal is to eventually have enough money to buy my own house (Ideally by the time I am 32). Houses are crazy expensive so I have no idea how I will afford that. 

4. Any tips regarding moving or living on Ottawa.  

I will also try to summarize myself as best as possible: 

* 26 years old, single. 
* Didn't go to University or College, but graduated High School. 
* Have 14k in savings 
* After years of self-learning I was able to land a Software Development position. Will make 42k/year after tax. 
* Currently in Toronto
* Will need to move to Ottawa ASAP

My husband and I are early career teachers in Ontario making approx. 65k each. We also tutor (and claim this income) at approx 15k/year combined for a total pre-tax income of roughly $145k. We get built-in raises each year as well (grid salary; between the two of us we get a raise of $7000 in pre-tax income yearly until we hit our max salaries of 100k).

We have $160k for a downpayment and were pre-approved by our broker for $780k on a 30-year amortization at approx. 1.85%

We are looking to purchase at around the 740/750 mark (so a mortgage on approx. 590,000), as we will also have parent help in the form of gift money for the next 3-5 years to dump money into the mortgage when it's allowed.

We will still have savings (approx. 35k+) and family support for renos/maintenance if needed. 

Are there any major flaws with this plan?? We want to be able to put a firm offer, as the housing market where we are regularly sees 25-35 offers on every sale, with no conditions.",23,1610550822.0,2021,2021-01-13,Housing,firsttimebuyers2021,4,kwicib

Any mortgage brokers here? How much house can we expect to get approved for?,"We are a small family of 3 in Ontario looking to buy a townhouse in the 450-500k range in the Guelph area or possibly Barrie. Our landlord is selling her condo soon. We don't have much income but have help from friends and family. Some finance details

Me: 50k before tax income as of last year. Great benefits. FT employed with the same company for 6 years. 750+ credit rating on both Equifax and Transunion

Wife: Income in 2019 was 10k. Income in 2020 was 5k. Credit rating is around 680

We have 90,000$ to put down as a down payment and cover closing costs

We have 25,000$ as an emergency fund to cover moving costs and some furniture. 

We have a cash business that doesn't get reported but keeps us comfortable with a higher payment. Approx 2000$/mo

No debt. A paid off vehicle worth about 20k 

We currently rent a condo with great references. Not sure if that matters? Our rent is 2200$/month. This amount is supported by our cash business and parents

We also have co-signers ready if needed and these are their details but ideally would not want to use them. 

Me: A trusted friend with a fairly high income, around 10k per month, and they also own their own house 

Wife: Parents with a paid off house living off their pensions.

Hoping to get PFC’s opinion on our short-to-medium term housing options,"Hi PFC,

First post here! My partner and I are in the process of making a decision regarding our short-to-medium term finances and we’re finding ourselves slightly unsure about our options. I suggested we post here to get your opinion since I have been finding the community extremely helpful.

We are both young working professionals currently renting a condo in Toronto. Our combined monthly income is about 8.1k and we both have high credit scores. In the next 5-6 years, we plan to move away from Canada and spend some time abroad before returning back to start a family and settle down. We both work in Toronto and would like to stay living here for convenience (in a condo preferably).

Our options are:

1. Continue renting (our rent currently eats up about 26% of our income) and invest/save as much as possible from the monthly leftover

2. Purchase a condo. Based on our calculations, the current prices, and how much downpayment we can put, we assume that the mortgage would eat up about 40-45% of our income (including an estimate of condo fees and property taxes). When the time comes to leave as per our plan, we would either sell the condo or rent it while living abroad.

Our questions are:

1. I understand the debate for rent vs buy is discussed here almost every day. But we want to get your opinions about the rent vs buy in a 5-6 year timeline. Do we gain anything from buying a property then selling/renting later or is our money better off being invested?

2. Being renters in the city, we can’t wrap our heads around how we can produce a positive cash flow if we decide to rent the property while living abroad. Mortgage, condos fees, and taxes don't exactly add up to how much we see units being rented for.

3. We wouldn't be able to come up with the downpayment without financial help from our families, which we are extremely lucky they are able and willing to support us with. Having said that, our families would only be willing to support us if we are purchasing a home (not towards investments if we rent). We also don’t think we can count on their support in the future if we decide to buy in say 10 years (i.e. would be leaving money on the table in a sense). Obviously, we understand how lucky we are to have this support, but perhaps it doesn’t make sense given our plans to move? I think this point creates quite a dilemma for us.

4. What are the implications of renting while living abroad?

5. Any other comments/opinions you may have are most welcome :)

Sorry for the lengthy post, looking forward to hearing back from you!",6,1610546250.0,2021,2021-01-13,Housing,oscarflood,5,kwgw6g
Transferring money from TFSA to RRSP (HBP)?,"Hi PFC,

I'm a novice looking for some guidance as I prepare to (hopefully) buy my first home. I have $30K in a TFSA, and $10K in a generic savings account for a total of $40K at this time. 


As I'm looking to buy a home later in the spring, I'm wondering if it would be better for me to open an RRSP account (I don't have one yet), and move my savings from the TFSA and savings accounts to the RRSP?


My understanding is that I would have to deposit the money for at least 90 days before withdrawal, and that the deadline for RRSP contributions for 2020 is March 1, 2021. I also understand there are deadlines for paying the amount back into my RRSP. 


With that in mind, I have the following questions:

* Would I still benefit from a tax refund under the HBP for the 2020 tax year if I deposit the money before March 1, but withdraw in spring 2021? 
* Are there any penalties for leaving a TFSA account empty?

Other relevant information:


* I live in Ontario
* I'm 27
* I make around $85K a year, and will likely stay in this tax bracket for the remainder of my career 


I've tried to do a bit of research on this myself, and am also considering consulting a financial planner as I feel I don't have a full grasp on the implications. In addition to that, I thought I would ask you. Is there anything else I should be considering/I'm missing?

TFSA Limits For A Non-Resident,"Ok my title may be a bit misleading. I arrived in Canada in 2013 but only received my Permanent Residency in 2018. My question is, does my contribution room start from when I landed in Canada ie.2013 or is my limits based off when TFSA became a thing in 2009? 

The reason I ask is that on my Wealthsimple account, it says I only have $35k of contribution space left despite only having $800 invested so far (new to investing). I do have bi-weekly deposits set @ $800 so I’m just wondering have they taken into account that automated deposit for the year and calculated my contribution from that.

How often are HELOCs actually called?,"Long time lurker, first time poster (36M). I've been thinking about implementing the Smith Manoeuvre on my home in the next year or so and am trying to evaluate the risks. I'm reading Robinson Smith's book right now, and enjoying it, and it makes it sound like there are very few drawbacks. 

I currently have about 22 years left on my mortgage so my time horizon is pretty long, and investing in XEQT in my non registered account is likely my strategy. I may also be able to implement the cash flow dam with a rental property which really seems to accelerate it. I'm looking into seeing up the HELOC but I'm mainly curious about two things: under what conditions can the bank call for the HELOC to be paid, and how often does this happen in practice? Like are there references or academic papers on this?

The major risk appears to be your non registered investments losing a large amount of value at the same time the bank calls for the HELOC to be paid. Honestly they likely aren't going to call upon it if times aren't tough, but with a long time horizon, even if my investments go down, as long as the loan isn't called it still make sense. Are there any other risk considerations I haven't looked at? My wife and I do have decent registered account investments, maybe not by this forums standards but we're on track by my calculations, so I could potentially use TFSA funds if I did have to cover a HELOC call.

Advice needed - Millennial looking to buy first home and depressed,"Hi, thanks for reading my post! :) my fiancé and I are both 28 and looking to buy our first home in the GTA. Our combined income is ~$270K and we are looking for a max $1M home (we don’t have $200k+ for a down payment). Unfortunately, we have started looking and spoken to a few real estate agents and have basically found out that we can’t really afford more than a townhouse or a semi that needs a lot of renos in our target areas, with the current state of the housing market. This has been a really hard fact to deal with and I’m so angry that this is what a high earning young couple can afford with a freaking million dollar budget! Meanwhile all of our friends have bought ahead of us with lower incomes but family help. My fiancé and I had to make it on our own with no help ever from parents, no living home rent free, student loans, etc. Turns out hard work doesn’t actually mean shit, despite what we were all told growing up.

My anger and sadness aside, I’m looking for advice on what to do. Should we:
a) Settle for what we can afford just to get on the ladder even though we really wanted a proper house with a yard to raise a family 
b) Continue renting for a little more while saving for a bigger down payment (really worried about falling further behind with this option given how fast prices are rising)
c) Move out of Canada. We’ve been thinking about this option more and more. My fiancé is in cyber security and I am in management consulting. Any advice as to where to move where we could find jobs and better value housing wise? Also would love to go somewhere warmer as we both hate the winters here.
d) Any other ideas, please!!!

Thanks so much!!

Just to pre-empt some expected responses:
-No, we can’t just move to the prairies. My fiancé’s career in cyber security doesn’t exist outside of major cities and work from home is not an option for him beyond COVID. 
-No, we don’t want to live in a a condo. We both work from home while COVID is around and need space. Plus we HATE condos (living in a box in the sky, among many many other reasons).
-No, we don’t want to give up on home ownership forever and rent. We want to have a family, and not have a landlord decide to kick us out of our home with 2 months’ notice.

EDIT: WOW, a lot of negative comments and downvotes. Perhaps the tone of this post was too dramatic out of frustration but it seems as though a lot of folks stop reading after our household income and jump straight to “you make a lot of money, stop complaining”. But I’m not complaining about our income, just about how hard it is to get into the housing market even with a really high income. A defence - my fiancé and I are both from poor immigrant families and we both grew up on welfare/food insecure households and had to work to support not just ourselves but also our families from a very young age. We’ve worked our ass off to get to where we are, making many sacrifices our peers never had to. And our high incomes have only happened very very recently. So yes, it IS unfair that we had to work twice and hard to get half as far as so many of our middle class peers.

EDIT #2: Some of you all are just rude. I get some of you are renters and feel shut out too. But the homeowners yelling at me - did you have to buy your first home in a market so hot that prices have gone up 15-20% in one year? Did you do it with no help (no parents paying for your education, no living at home rent free as an adult, no one else paying your bills, no gifts or loans from parents)? No? Then stop telling me IM privileged and not “entitled” to a nice place to live even though I have done absolutely everything right despite starting on the back foot.",72,1610509100.0,2021,2021-01-12,Housing,CarmenL8,0,kw83p3

Quick question regarding TFSA Contribution limits,"I'm currently 23 with about 40,000~ contribution limit, (haven't used a TFSA until now) and i see this year's limit is $6000. Does this mean I can only contribute 6000 in this year, or I can contribute up to my maximum limit? (my total contribution limit of 40,000 includes this year's 6000 already), but just wanted to clarify to be on the safe side.

Also another question regarding withdrawals. Say I've already maximized my limit of $40,000 and i chose to withdraw the entire amount today. Theoretically, this should free up my limit back to $40,000, so when am I able to re-contribute this amount back to my TFSA?",9,1610504454.0,2021,2021-01-12,Investing,BestServerNA,0,kw6ra3

Severance directly into an RRSP,"An employer is closing their company.

They are paying severance and are requesting for me to receive it in one of two ways:
- straight payment of 20k
- direct placement of 28k into an RRSP account of my choice

The reason for the 8k difference as stated by them is due to the RRSP direct deposit not including the tax component (how do they know the tax amount) + CPP + EI.

Which should I chose?

Let me know if you have any questions.


Edit: Thanks for the responses.  Decided to take the lump sum.

Confirmed that as part of severance:

* Severance payout does not deduct CPP and EI

* Severance payout begins at the time you were given notice.  So in my case does not impact EI because the duration of severance being paid out will be complete prior to me applying for EI.",13,1610501329.0,2021,2021-01-12,Taxes,TheRealBort,3,kw5tpb

Transfer Margin to RRSP Questrade - Confirming ACB,"Hey folks,

This will be my first time having a taxable event in an unsheltered account so I wanted to confirm I got my ACB correct;

My math as follows for shares of VEQT:

(All in 2020, there doesn't appear to be any distributions during this period)

* 240 @ $20.72 = $4972.8
* 200 @ $23.71 = $4742
* 207 @ $25.36 = $5249.52
* 343 @ $29.22 = $10022.46

Total bought:

* 990 shares for $24986.78

Account activity just has one line item for transfer done in Dec 2020 for all 990 shares;

* ""VANGUARD ALL-EQUITY ETF PORTFOLIO ETF UNIT RSP CONTRIBUTION TO ACCOUNT xxxxx BOOK VALUE $31,244.40""

Is this line item the one considered for the ""sale"" taxable event?

If so are my ""capital gains"" simply $31,244.40 - $24986.78 = **$6257.62**

And therefore I would add $6257.62 / 2 = **$3128.81** to my taxable income for 2020?",8,1610498484.0,2021,2021-01-12,,BigCheapass,1,kw4yo1

Will TFSA survive 2021?,"After an interesting project in economic about current events, one result predicted the ending of the Tax-Free Saving Account in 2021 or 2022.

Does anyone have any predictions or forethought on this?

Edit:

My apologies for the vague question, I was rushed.

Our class, in groups, were presented with the current economic outlook, with a few predictions that this is going to get better before it gets worse. Half the groups focused on the American economy and the other on the Canadian economy. Comparing graphs and stats afterwards.

We were expected to come up with solutions to solve the impending debt level crisis with an estimated interest increase of one present per year for 3 years.

My group focused generally on reductions in government spending, and a number of internal practices.

However, I was intrigued (I don't mean I liked this, but it was interesting) by other groups' ideas about locking the TFSA amount. Allowing bracket creep of the inflation rate, and lowering RRSP room.

I just wondered what the old Reddit group thought.

American Job Offer - Questions,"Hi All,

Long time lurker - posting on an ALT to maintain some degree of privacy.

I've recently been offered a job with a US company. I'm a Canadian citizen. The current plan will be for me to work remote for some period of time until COVID settles. Subsequently, I'll be relocating to the US. My plan ATM will be to either live there while working, or to try to do 3 weeks on, 3 weeks in Canada (or something of that nature, tbd).

My main questions/concerns are:

* Tax implications (state is California)?

* Direct deposit info - Can my wage be DD'd into my current Canadian account or do I need to setup an American chequing account? I'm with a big Canadian bank, so, ideally, I'd like to stick with them for the US side to make money transfer between accounts easier.

* I'm married w/ kids. The scenarios now are I'd be working away from them until things settle and then we'd re-evaluate. Spouse wouldn't work right away since I'd be on a TN. Issues here? Is it easier to just keep them in Canada (although painful since I love my family dearly..)?

* What happens to my Canadian benefits/EI/OAS and the like? I'm covered for benefits in America with my employer - but I feel kind of guilty not contributing to the basic Canadian services - Always been a big fan of trying to put back into the system more than I take out.

The job offer is exciting, but well outside of my comfort zone. Any other help/advice would be appreciated.

Aunt with Parkinson's has spent hundreds of thousands and is now near-broke. What to do?,"Making this on an anonymous account.

I will try to keep this as short as possible. But it’s hard, and I’m fighting back tears trying to write this.

My aunt is 60 years old. She’s had Parkinson’s Disease for over 15 years now. She was a nurse and lived frugally. Now it’s the complete opposite. We’ve had our suspicions for a while about how bad things were (she pulled out money from her fully maxed TFSA 2 years ago, missed bill payments, interest charges) , but I was finally able to get access to her finances (without her knowing).  **She has about $4.5K in her chequing account. $13K in Credit Card Bills, and $150K in savings**.

This doesn’t sound too bad, but my dad estimates that she had about 600-700K from the sale of her house 5 years ago. She’s now in a condo. Mortgage is paid off. $800 in condo fees/month with roughly 6K in property tax. She lives alone.

**In short, She’s blown \~300K in the past 5 years**. She has spent roughly *20K a year on Amazon*. We get stupid s\*\*t from her literally every week (clothes, DVDs, books).  We also know that she is ‘lending’ money to a ‘friend’ of hers in Florida. She gave them $2,500 in cash for Christmas + hundreds of Amazon s\*\*t.  Her spending has gotten worse as the disease has progressed. We believe that she has Parkinson's related dementia.

I don’t know what to do. She gave me her account information in case she passed. But I accessed it because I knew things were spiralling out of control, and it’s worse than what we thought.

She now has a mild form of a breast cancer, and she’s been spending as if she’s going to die at any moment. However, people with Parkinson’s can live past 70. Naturally, **we are worried that she won’t have the money to pay for her care, which with time, will increase**. She should already be in an assisted living facility with 24/7 care, but she refuses to move again.

Has anybody had to deal with anything like this? I know my Dad and my other aunt (her sister) have tried to talk to her about this. But then she gets defensive and starts crying.

*The silver lining (or perhaps its why she’s spending so much) is that she will inherit roughly $2M after-tax if my Grandma (90) passes away.* So if worse comes to worse, she SHOULD have money to cover her living expenses for another 10 years or so. We estimate assisted living care will cost her minimum 7-8K/month. This is before her buying amazon stuff, giving money to friends she’s never met, etc. However, my Grandma is in pretty good health and could easily live another 5-6 years. I.E, My aunt would run out of her money before my Grandma dies. My dad has explored the possibility of getting the inheritance to be in trust, but my other aunt wants the money right away. So the idea has been pushed aside as the belief has always been that it should be divided equally between the 3 of them.

I feel guilty for betraying her trust and looking at her financial info. But I also think that I’m justified given her disease. If she spent the money on donations to Parkinson’s research, good care, a cottage, a boat (something she’s always dreamed of), we wouldn’t be upset. But literally she has pissed away her money on useless trinkets and giving money away to people she’s never met.

**What the hell do we do?** FWIW. My brother and I have power of attorney. She took power of attorney away from Dad (I guess she thought he'd intervene).

Thanks (and apologies for the bold. I hope it's coherent and wanted to highlight the basic facts)

Looking for recommendations on where to start," 

Hey guys I’m looking for some direction on where to head regarding beginning the process of investing my money. I am a 22 year old with a full time job 35k (salary will double within 4 years as I reach top level in my seniority program) I currently am debt free and have my vehicle paid off (with living at home my monthly expenses are $300 for rent / phone bill) I feel as if I am in a good position to get ahead/start early with my investments but I’m not entirely sure where I should start my research. I currently have a TFSA account with 25k in it at a credit union (it’s set at 1.60% interest) currently I do plan on keeping the majority of the funds in there and letting them build for a few years but I am looking to take about 5k of this and begin to put it to other places. I currently don’t have the knowledge to manage my own funds so I thought possibly a auto directed TFSA’ account with quest trade could be a good place to start? I also know that currently I am not interested in day trading. Ideally I am looking for help on where to start researching for a security/investment that I can park my money for some years (3-5) possibly longer and let it grow if the market is good.

I’m not certain if I’ll be eligible for EI or which financial aid would work best for me. In the past, I’ve applied for CESB (Canada emergency student benefit) since I’m a university student and CRSB (Canada recovery sickness benefit) since I had to self isolate for two weeks. 

I’ve worked for 4 months in 2020 at that job. I began the first week of September and my lay off began January 2.

Tax Return Options - Invest? Paydown mortgage? Paydown Car Loan?,"Hi everyone,

With tax return season coming soon and potential bonus rounds for employees I wanted some insight and suggestions on what to do with the funds.

Facts:

1. mortgage at 2.89% with $400k balance
2. Car Loan at 3.99% with 30k balance
3. Debt free otherwise, no CC balances.

I am expecting a return of around 5-8k along with potential for bonus from my employer (1-5k). The options are:

1. Invest with Wealthsimple - TFSA
2. Put into a RRSP investment account
3. Prepay portion of mortgage
4. Prepay portion of car loan

I want some recommendations on what to do or what others have done. I guess the bottom line is will the return on investments out pace the 2.89-3.99% interest rate.

My bf trips over 100$ to save a quarter.,"Hi everyone! My first post here.

I am in a fairly good financial state considering all things. I’m 30, in no debt, have a little savings - all on a minimum wage life. (Single mother as well with no child support).

My current partner of 1 year, however is not in such great standing. I read the article here about how to choose a partner to support your finances and felt a little called out. Granted my partner doesn’t ask me for money, and we don’t share finances. (He also doesn’t beat me  😅) He got into debt as he was too nice and no one paid him back. It sort of spiralled. 

One of my friends recently stated, my bf “trips over a 100$ bill to save a quarter.” Which I had never heard the expression before, but it seems to fit. He works like a dog and has not been able to crawl out of debt. He always has these elaborate plans to “fix everything” and they never seem to pan out. To be very clear, he wants to get out of debt but just seems to go about it the wrong way.

He does not like me being involved in his finances, but I only want to try and help as I know his finances will affect any large future dreams of mine. 

What kind of advice could I give him? How can I support him? He says his finances are not my business, but I feel they kind of are if I want to even vaguely plan anything for the future with him. 

(Breaking up with him is currently not in the suggestion box, so please do not mention it. The rest of our relationship is very good.)",19,1610482887.0,2021,2021-01-12,Debt,lvlvlemonpants,0,kvzt5w
Yearly salary increases and paternity leave,"So the way my employer works (non-union and provincially regulated job in Alberta) works, is we get a salary increase every year, which is tied to job performance on a scale of 1-5.  For simplicity lets say 1's  get 1%, 2's get 2% etc.   


My yearly review gave me a 5/5, but I'm told that due to being gone half the year, I'll get 2.5% increase.  Is that fair or since I was taking a job protected leave, and the time is to count as continual service i would have a fair argument for the full 5%?

TFSA - Need help understanding withdrawals and effects on contribution limits,"I need some help in understanding how this works....

Paying your taxes as a small business (partnership),"Hi again folks

So my wife and I have started a small business and it's going decent so far. We use quickbooks to manage everything but the one looming thing at the end of 2021 is how we go about our taxes. I had a few questions:

1) is there an easy-ish way to estimate what we will owe? A calculator somewhere to input revenue vs claimed expenses etc? Maybe something I'm overlooking on quickbooks 

2) when I do my business taxes and get a tax bill - is it due all at once or do I pay in increments through the following year?

3) on quickbooks: should I set my wife and I (coowners) up as employees for the pay system to factor in any costs like CPP? I've just been tracking what we take out as an ""Owner Draw"" expense for tracking 

I'll have a business accountant do the work for us near the end of the year but its probably too early to have them at the moment since we just started this month

Edit: should mention we have no actual employees and not incorporated

"Almost 100k in my mutual funds, should i switch to wealthsimple?","Hey All,

So curious to hear your opinions. I'm 35 and have amassed almost 100k in my TSFA. I'm using Manulife securities and have had it all in this fund from the start:

[https://ci.com/en/funds/daily-prices/CINorthAmericanDividendFund.html?currencySelector=1&seriesId=1764](https://ci.com/en/funds/daily-prices/CINorthAmericanDividendFund.html?currencySelector=1&seriesId=1764)CI NORTH AMERICAN DIVIDEND FUND AT8 -FE (CIG50877)

Essentially the way it was explained to me when I first started is that the share prices themselves will not grow much past where it started (about 10$ per share) and the value is in the dividend payments.

When I started the share price was about 10$ and over the years it went down to almost 7.50 and now it's back up to 9.77.. all the while I've always bought month over month... So i consider myself buying shares on sale...

Anyways the dividends currently are paying about  $0.0664 per unit and i have  9,738.1030 units. This means on a monthly basis the dividend payment is $646.61 which goes back to buy more units.

The MER is about 2.18 (roughly $2000 in fees per year now). That's about 3 months worth of dividend payments.

&#x200B;

My goal is retirement, I'm not taking out of the fund, I've maxed out my contribution room and I'll keep adding every year to max it out.

&#x200B;

My question is that is it smart to keep it in there or should I look at something like wealthsimple robo advisor with 1/4 of the fees

"Why I left Questrade as a Platinum client, and why you should too.","EDIT 1/19: Shortly after posting this, I received a message from Questrade's customer support, and was put in touch with Questrade's executive team. They promptly resolved all my outstanding issues to my satisfaction. 

tl;dr: Their customer service is now terrible. We're talking me having to initiate contact over a dozen times to process a simple transfer, them nearly costing me 5 figures of tax liability, and them transferring 6 figures of stock to the wrong account and then ignoring me forever.

I've been a Questrade client since 2009. I've advocated for them, and am a ""Platinum"" client (>$250k, entitles you to ""priority"" support). No more.

My ex-wife and I recently signed a separation agreement, and the terms included 1) Me rolling over some of my RRSP to her and 2) Us equally dividing a joint unregistered account between us. Simple, right? Apparently not for Questrade.

I first called the Platinum line October 7 and waited 20 minutes (standard wait time, as I'd learn). I was told to sign some transfer forms, email them in, and they'd process things. I suggest I need a T2220 (Spousal RRSP rollover form), I'm told no need. Cool, that sounds easy enough. I sent them in within the hour.

2 days later, no response, I followed up. 3 days later, no response, I followed up. 4 days later, no response, I called in again, and was told I had to ""upload"" the documents rather than emailing them. This pattern of me having to check in on them would prove to be the standard.

Then I was told I'd need to upload the separation agreement. I did so.

Cue no response, and me following up on Oct 10, Oct 12, Oct 13, all emails disappearing into the Questrade support black hole.

Oct 14 I call again and talk to a rep who gives me his personal extension, which I'd come to memorize over the following weeks! He says I need to upload the transfer forms again, so I do.

Oct 15 I'm summarily informed by email form letter than all my transfer requests have been cancelled because my ex's account is ""in the wrong status"". I call my guy, who tells me to tell my ex to call Questrade support. Fine.

For brevity I'll spare you some minutiae here of me initiating contact three more times, going back and forth over ""corrupted"" documents and misunderstandings about what I'm asking for.

Finally Oct 22 the transfers complete! Alas, I notice they have processed the RRSP rollover as a WITHDRAWAL AND DEREGISTRATION, which will attribute 6 figures of income to me and permanently lose me that much RRSP room. Shaken, I call my guy again and demand this be fixed immediately. 

Four days go by with no communication, so of course I follow up again and am told they do in fact need the T2220 form to process the RRSP rollover, like I suggested in my initial contact. Unfortunately they don't know how to fill out the form properly. I fill it out, send it in, wait 2 days, call in, am told I filled it out wrong and to do this part differently. Then I repeat that process for a third time.

Finally they fix it, and I immediately transfer all my assets to another broker. Phew! Unfortunately this story isn't over.

Two months later my ex calls me and asks what's taking so long for transfer #2 (splitting the joint account). I go through my statements in detail and notice that THEY TRANSFERRED BOTH HALVES OF THE JOINT ACCOUNT TO MY PERSONAL ACCOUNT, despite signed transfer forms to the contrary. Of course simply reversing this isn't possible since I've since moved the assets away from Questrade.

I'm now working with my new broker to create an account there for my ex so I can transfer her what she's owed. There are obviously tax implications here that I am working with a tax lawyer to solve.

I emailed Questrade Platinum support about this last fuckup on Dec 18 and Dec 30, warning them that I would detail this story publicly, but they have summarily ignored me both times, probably because I'm no longer a client and so they couldn't care less. 

Let me be very clear about that last part. They transferred 6 figures of stock to the wrong account, and then when informed of their error multiple times they ignored me for a month and counting.

I guess the moral of the story is you get what you pay for.",500,1610473897.0,2021,2021-01-12,,cecilpl,1798,kvwng8
Taxes: Can you still claim the $400 WFH deduction if your employer gave you a home office stipend?,"I'm sorry if this is a dumb question, or if it's been asked before. I recall someone saying this in an old thread on the topic, and there was a bit of disagreement between users. I couldn't find a straight answer via search.

At the beginning of the pandemic, some employers gave stipends toward home office equipment (desk, chair, etc.) My understanding is because you got a stipend for it, you cannot claim those expenses in the long-form (not the simplified $400 one) WFH deduction. Similarly if your employer gave you a stipend for your work cell, you can't claim your work cell on the complex deduction. And so on and so forth. Basically, don't double-dip.

But does having received a home office stipend for something like furniture disqualify you from claiming the simplified $400 deduction more broadly? I'm using a lot more hydro than I was previously (especially in the summer... top floor apartment in an old house, it gets HOT), and it would be nice to recoup some of that.",14,1610473737.0,2021,2021-01-12,Taxes,timhortonsbitchass,13,kvwlhs

Looking for some advice...

I am a 30 year old health care professional. I am looking on advice for what I should be doing with my RRSP's that my previous employer was matching but I have gotten a new job. What did you do with your RRSP's when you moved to your new job? I am not happy with the company I have my RRSP's with and I called to see about withdrawing the funds to another RRSP or taking it and putting into a TFSA but I am looking as losing around 400 dollars with 10% tax withhold, $100 account closure fee and $25 withdrawal fee. In regards to my financial history, I pay into a pension plan through my new job, I have savings in my TFSA for retirement, own a house as an income property, have a small LOC but am working on paying that off in the next year. I am unsure on what to do with my RRSP's at this point.

I have considered moving the money into my TFSA account for savings but also considered taking the money from the RRSP's to put onto my LOC to pay off debt. I met with a financial advisor and she told me to take the money and put it into my TFSA as I will be in a lower tax bracket this year as I will be going off on maternity leave in March. As of right now, I am getting charged ten dollars a month for not contributing to the RRSPs and am looking on moving the money sooner then later.

Any tips would be helpful!

"Spreading your retirement over the course of your life instead of waiting 65 years old, is it possible?","Whenever I do financial planning for retirement, I can't help but to think that I actually don't care about having a great end-of-life. 

I'm 30 and already have had chronic health problems for about 10 years now. Also, none of my grandfathers lived passed 70 so I hardly see myself living that long to be honnest.

We really like Ottawa and the surrounding areas, but homes in Quebec seem to be a lot cheaper and we have lots of family there.   


I've always avoided the idea of Quebec because neither of us speak French and I imagine it would be very hard to get a job. Plus I believe the taxes are higher and may upset the savings? (I've no clue on the numbers so if anyone could offer insight it would be great).   


We have been thinking of working for ourselves from home, which would mean the French part shouldn't be as much of a deal. But I'd like know I can at least find a job if things don't work out with work from home.   


any insight would be highly appreciated.",9,1610469023.0,2021,2021-01-12,Housing,Unikatze,1,kvuymi

"Investing cash in 2nd mortgages, private loans","Did anybody do this before?

I found a company in Mississauga that does investments in private loans, 2nd mortgages, 1st mortgages. The return is 6%-11%, depends on the risk factor. 
It sounds like a pyramid scheme that you see on discovery channel "" American Greed"" haha, but everything goes through a lawyer, they put a lean on persons property, before you send the money and all. I dont see anything wrong with it, but ive never done it, but very serious in investing 200k with them...

What happens if the borrower doesnt pay, am i able to buy them out and keep their property?
What are cons? What are the bad things, because i only see gains or im blinded by their sales pitch?

Looking for some guidance on setting up an ETF portfolio,"Apologies for posting often here, but as I delve into personal finance at a beginner stage, naturally, many many questions are unearthing themselves.

I'm going to migrate to questrade soon, but I'd like to be a little more secure knowing what ETFs to buy. Since I want low-cost long-term growth portfolio, I know people have recommended VGRO and VEQT for this approach. VFV could also work here right? But since VFV tracks the S&P500, would it be counter productive to hold VEQT and VFV as VFV stocks are essentially included in VEQT? 

How does VGRO and VEQT differ? At the risk of sounding ignorant, which one is better for a long-term growth portfolio? 

Another question I have is equity allocation. If I want a 90% stock, 10% bond equity allocation, but VGRO or VEQT only offers, say 70% stock, or 30% bond allocation, is there a way to modify the allocation? Someone answered this:  

*I hold XEQT and VGRO for a 90/10 allocation to equities and fixed income with a 50:50 fund allocation*. 

Can someone explain to me what this means exactly?

Advantages/Disadvantages of double insurance coverage between spouses?,"Good morning all,

My spouse and I both have health insurance plans with our respective employers.  We never got around to adding each other as spouses on our health plans.  It has been pretty separate up to this point.  So now we are looking to add each other onto our plans.  Is there any disadvantage to this?  I assume coordination of benefits is an advantage.  We're both 31, engaged, no dependents at this time.

\- I am in Construction, my employer covers the cost of health and dental plans.  I don't pay anything out of pocket.  Standard health coverage and rockin dental coverage.  
\- She is in technology at one of the big 5.  They have tiered plans, so your selected health/dental coverage determines how much you pay out of pocket each month.  She selected premium health coverage and low dental coverage...pays a decent amount out of pocket.  I am assuming if I'm added to the plan, there may be more deducted? Not sure yet.

Trying to understand Gross Debt Service Ratio and Total Debt Service Ratio for a mortgage,"Hi all, newbie here... we're planning on leaving Toronto and moving to a small city to buy a home as it's the only place we can afford and I am able to continue working from home. My salary is good (95K) but we've accumulated a decent amount of consumer debt over the years which we're working hard at paying down (26K total). We're looking at houses in the 250K - 300K range with a 50K down payment (from my parents). I'm really worried I won't be approved for a mortgage because of my debt. I'm currently making about $600 a month in payments towards the debt (2 credit cards, 1 line of credit). I'm planning on using my tax refund to pay off one card so that will take the total debt down to about 20K next month. Paying $600 a month towards the debt leaves me with a GDS of 14% and a TDS of 23%. 

Does anyone know what my chances will be of actually being approved? The mortgage payment (plus property tax and heating) will be less than what I'm currently paying in rent and I'll be able to pay the debt down faster if we can move since cost of living will decrease as well.",7,1610463267.0,2021,2021-01-12,,tamlynn88,2,kvt4ka
Is it time to sell my condo in Montreal?,"Looking at how prices have increased over the last couple years, and the forecast for the future seeing suburban sales jump and supply start to catch up to demand in downtown, I wonder if this is the best opportunity for me to sell.

I own a 1 bedroom condo in the Ville-Marie (downtown) area. Looking at the market in my building alone, I think I could swing a 100K profit (before sales expenses), with $170Kish cash on hand after sale.

Forecasts seem to disagree that prices may go up or down in 2021, but it seems they agree that prices will become more affordable in the long term than they are now.

Are there any good reasons not to split the difference with XGRO and VGRO or XBAL and VBAL?,"Vanguard and iShares offer a set of very similar, but not quite identical all-in-one globally diversified index ETFs. The differences are covered well here: https://canadiancouchpotato.com/2020/12/20/asset-allocation-etf-showdown-vanguard-vs-ishares/

Performance over time has thus far tended to be quite similar. But there are some differences in underlying holdings that might produce somewhat more divergent outcomes under extreme circumstances.

Assuming a tax sheltered account, and no additional trading fees: are there any good reasons not to simply split the difference and invest in roughly half of each?

All I can think of is that if you didn't rebalance between them, but just made bulk purchases of one or the other, you are subtly changing the asset allocation in your portfolio with every purchase.

Personal Finance for Newcomers,"Hi!

I know that my post might sound naive but I feel kind of overwhelmed right now and I would really appreciate it if someone more familiar with the Canadian financial system comments on my plans.

So, if everything goes as planned, my girlfriend and I will be coming to Canada in summer as permanent residents. If it matters, we are considering Ontario as our main destination.

We have approx. 30 000 CAD of savings.
We want to leave 5000 CAD (for a month of spending) in a bank in the country that we come from — it will allow us to use these funds in Canada easily and we will be okay until we are able to go to a bank in Canada (especially if we have to self-isolate first). We will bring the rest in cash.

Then we go into one of the Top 5 banks (or should we choose a smaller bank? A credit union? An online bank?) and do the following:
1. Open two TFSA accounts and put $6000 into each of them (the contribution room for 2021).
2. Open two checking accounts and put the rest of money into them.
3. Get two credit cards for each of us to start building our credit history.

We will definitely monitor all banking offers a month in advance so that we could probably find a better interest rate or some additional perks.

We are not currently looking into investments or anything that might diminish our funds or limit our access to them in the short-term. 

So is everything ok with this plan? Is there anything else that we should do in the first several months?

"Father passed away, trying to manage family's finances and investments","My father passed away a few months ago and I'm currently trying to plan my family's/mother's investments since my father is the one who take care of investing for our family. I'd really appreciate any help/suggestions since I'm still in university and don't have that much experience handling finances/investing yet.

&#x200B;

My mom plans to retire in about 6-8 years and has no major expenses left since their mortgage was paid off. Once retired, she probably won't exceed more than the 15% marginal tax rate on income (\~$49k) and will probably spend less. All of my father's assets have been transferred over and I will refer to everything as hers which is \~$1.2M in assets, not including our home.

&#x200B;

We've already allocated 6 months worth of emergency savings outside of this \~$1.2M and plan on investing the rest. She's maxed out her TFSA and RRSP, so we have \~$260k (21.7%) that we plan to put in a non-registered account.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Summary Breakdown:

\~1.2M in investments, not including home

\~260k (21.7%) cash that we plan on putting in non-registered account

\~550k (45.8%) individual TSX60 stocks, mainly banks

\~90k (7.5%) individual US stocks, US Banks + Pfizer

\~50k (4.2%) Apple + Amazon

\~195k (16.3%) ETF indexes and mutual funds that are 70% Canadian, 25% US, 5% International

\~105k (8.8%) GIC/Bonds

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Questions

1. When my mom retires she plans to pull from her RRSP first (\~590k right now) so she potentially won't need to touch the non-registered account for 12-15+ years. Does this mean she should purchase something like VGRO or even entirely equity ETFs like VFV and ZNQ in this account?
2. Should she use the Horizon swap based ETFs like HXT, HXS, and HXQ in this non-registered account for the tax advantages?
3. I noticed the current percentage of GIC/bonds is pretty low compared to somewhat conservative Canadian Couch Potato portfolios like VBAL and VCNS. Would this matter for her situation? If the emergency savings + existing 105k should be able to sustain her lifestyle for 3 years, I assume there's no need to purchase an amount greater than this?
4. The percentage of international exposure in this portfolio seems very small to me and based off of emerging trends I'm seeing in China, South East Asia, Taiwan, I feel it might make sense to allocate some percentage of the portfolio to this as well. What's an international exposure percentage that would make sense in this case?
5. Any ideas for how it might make sense to restructure this portfolio or anything that sticks out as odd?
6. Are there any good guides you recommend for helping me learn more about finances and investing?

Are Canwise financial known for having good mortgage products?,"I’m looking at a home purchase and Canwise financial (which is owned by ratehub.ca) has far lower interest rates than other lenders my original mortgage broker is able to secure. While my broker is offering 1.59% on a 5 year fixed, Canwise is offering 1.39% plus $2000 cash back. 

My concern is that there are penalties or something that I’m not aware of which will make this a potentially bad or risky deal. Anyone have experience with Canwise in the rest of the mortgage process?

From the broker when i asked about penalties:

“If you were to sell your property during the term you would have the below options:

“Payout the existing balance from the sale proceeds and pay the penalty at the time (5 YR Fixed rate would be the greater of 3-Months Interest or Interest Rate Differential) and get a new mortgage with any lender at market rates. 

“Port the existing mortgage over to the new property (purchase would have to be within +/- 90 days of your sale) and if you do not require any more funds you would not incur any penalties, basically continue the mortgage as is.

“If you require new funds and want to avoid any penalty you would port the mortgage over to the new property and would receive a blended rate between your current rate and rates available at the time of closing and full penalty reimbursement.”


This all seems fine to me at this point, and similar to what my other broker’s penalty structure was.

I’m looking to sell in the spring after having rented it out the past 5 years. I’m wondering if anyone has advice on choosing (or negotiating with) real estate agents? There will be no staging or cleaning required and I’d like to get as low of a rate as possible on commission. 

Any other advice here is also welcome, I’ll be splitting everything with my sister. 

Basically I’m asking PFC what would YOU do?",9,1610423320.0,2021,2021-01-11,Housing,Junior_ranger_dice,0,kvjn9l
New vehicle before new home; bad idea?,"I am currently shopping for a new home, but am also considering purchasing a new vehicle and I was curious about something. If I currently have a monthly vehicle payment of \~$700 with \~$18,000 still owing and I purchase a brand new vehicle worth \~$65,000 with monthly payments around the same $700 mark, would that have any affect on my mortgage approval? I'm thinking it shouldn't because my debt-service ratio of monthly income vs monthly owed will remain the same. I'm just concerned that the increase from $18,000 owing to $65,000 owing will cause a red flag with the mortgage lender.

What is everyone's thoughts on this?

&#x200B;

edit: I was unclear in the original post. I would be trading the current vehicle (18,000 owing, worth \~22,000-28,000) for the new vehicle (\~65,000) and would be trying to keep the monthly payments around the current $700 mark, thereby not increasing my monthly expenses, but having a new vehicle.",13,1610423249.0,2021,2021-01-11,,x_slash,0,kvjmj6

Basic advice for the financially illiterate,"My sister... love her to bits but she does not know the first thing about money, saving, investing, etc...  She's the person who falls victim to those grocery store credit card sales people, or any sales pitch.  She's in her early 30's, single, has always lived paycheck to paycheck, zero savings or investments, and doesn't have any credit cards because they just get her into debt.

I want to guide her to set herself up for her future. It actually stresses me out thinking about her money habits.   Problem is, I don't know the best place to start helping her.  I asked her recently if she pays into an RRSP and she said ""no but I should!"". Now I'm worried she's going to walk into a bank and  the ""financial advisor"" will see dollar signs with her lack of investment knowledge and willingness to do whatever they advise. I'd love for her to forego the bank route, but she needs some professional guidance, that is free or VERY affordable or she'll never go.

Do I...

Tell her to hold off on any sort of investing and just focus on saving? I've read the steps in the wiki and this seems most logical for her.  If so, she needs some sort of goal to work towards or she will lose interest fast.   I don't want to just throw the wiki steps at her as that will completely overwhelm her.  Any sort of 101 advise I can give her.

When she's ready to actually invest, where is a good place for her to turn to for help without going the bank route?  TIA",9,1610422467.0,2021,2021-01-11,Investing,kayjay86,0,kvjem5

Laid off. Transferring Manulife RPP to Questrade LIRA & RRSP,"Hi everyone, long time lurker & first post – thank you for all the advice and wisdom. 

I was laid off this past December and since 2017 have had an Ontario defined contribution registered pension plan (DC RPP) with Manulife. According to the contract, plan sponsor (employer) contributions vested immediately and are locked in (~$15K). I also made voluntary member contributions, which are not locked-in (~$10k). Manulife didn’t send me any papers, but when I called they confirmed receiving my termination papers. I would like to transfer out to my Questrade LIRA and Questrade RRSP accounts – then buy VGRO of course :)


When I called Manulife, they emailed me the CRA T2151 and ML-T2033 transfer-out forms with no other info – makes sense as they’re losing managed money and can’t gouge me when I lose group rates. I chatted with Questrade and they weren’t too confident but said I should try filling out the forms twice – once to transfer the $15k locked-in RPP to my Questrade LIRA and again to transfer the $10k unlocked/voluntary contributions to my Questrade RRSP. 

Has anyone else done this and is this the correct way of doing this?






I’ve seen lots of different info on transfers and RRSP contribution room – I think because defined benefit is very different. My understanding is that both of the above transfers will not affect my RRSP contribution room because employer DC RPP portion doesn’t count and my voluntary RPP contributions led to the T4 pension adjustments. Is this correct?",10,1610419248.0,2021,2021-01-11,Retirement,richardlin23,8,kvigac
PFC I would like to hear your opinion,"25 year old from Winnipeg. I would like to hear your opinion on how I should go about spending the money I'm about to earn this year.

I was lucky enough to land a job during the pandemic after rigorous job hunting and applying. I graduated in June 2020 and accepted a job last October. My salary is $55k/yr CAD with yearly salary increase, I take home about 39k after taxes. I recently set up my RRSP contribution, did this due to my employer matching up to 5% of my base pay.

The money I earn goes to the following.

* Student loan:  $331/month ($24k federal with 2.45% interest + $10k provincial)
* RRSP contribution: $106 bi-weekly 
* Phone: $73/month
* Car insurance: $142/month
* Gas: approx. $225/month
* Life insurance: $13/month
* Rent (living with my parents): $150/month
* Ordered/going out food: $250/month (mostly from ordering food for breakfast on weekends and buying Tim's at night)
* Groceries: $300/month 
* Invisalign: $265/month (two payments left)
* CC debt: $2k (paying this as soon as I can)

All of the things above sums up to $23,094 which would give me $15,906 as my disposable income. I know that the RRSP would decrease my taxes but I don't know by how much. I plan to travel a bit in the future with my girlfriend when this pandemic is over so I plan to save up for that.

So far my plan is to immediately build a 3-month emergency savings, contribute to my TFSA after that, and then build a savings for a house (I plan to buy in 3 - 4 years).  

I own an old car (07 Mazda 3) which I bought 2 years ago, it had 2 visits to the mechanic last year to get fixed. I do the oil change myself. I'm currently tempted to replace it with a newer used car but couldn't justify it. My main issues with are; it has no AC, the tires need to be replaced soon, I don't trust the vehicle for long-drive use. The car I'm attracted to right now is worth $32k and I think I probably can't afford it.

What is the best way for my mother to utilize the $$ she has and live a fruitful retirement.," 

Evening PFC,

I am researching what is the best avenue for my mother to invest what little she has and to survive off it for the rest of her life.

Details: 

She is 66 yrs old 

No debt No mortgage 

Renting an apartment for $1500 a month. 

Owns her car. 

She has $130,000 from her house sale to invest and survive on.

Income: 

Old Age Security and CPP: $1400 a month after taxes total 

Works Part Time: $1600 a month after taxes

&#x200B;

I know there are Retirement ETF's that pay monthly dividends, which I am looking into for her.

She dreams of moving way up North and buying a small bungalow to retire in but I am worried it will be quite difficult with the housing market as it is. Also worried she will not be able to get a mortgage at her age.

Any thoughts, Idea's or Input is greatly appreciated. I just want my mother to have a great retirement and rest of her life. She worked so hard for me and my siblings.

Thanks PFC.",11,1610417693.0,2021,2021-01-11,,ruby420,10,kvi05r

Family friend convinced me to sign up for Primerica and now I’m confused,"I had a family friend reach out to me about Primerica a few days ago and we discussed it through video chat. I’m not the best when it comes to financial literacy so I can’t tell if I got played or not. 

The family friend was explaining to me what Primerica was about and when they told me to sign up I just thought it was for their financial need analysis and their one month free trial (since they have mentioned to me that they’ll cover for the first month). I agreed but when I was asked for my SIN was when I started to feel a bit confused. I proceeded to the sign up because I thought I could be trusted by this family friend.

When I was emailed the contract it mentions that I am an independent contractor with Primerica and that’s when I got really concerned. My main priority was to just explore my options for life insurance and not sign up to work for them? 

I know I should have taken a few days to think about it before signing anything but didn’t think much of it until after the meeting. I didn’t give out any bank info but they do have my SIN so I was wondering if this would affect my taxes or any financial and personal info? Also what did I actually sign up for?

From my understanding most, do public accounting (ie Big 4) as fresh grad for a few years, then switch into industry later.

A quick google search reveals, that most CPAs earn 100k+ plus, and some earn even more.

How driven and well-rounded do you have to be to obtain 100k+ salary?  Does your salary continue to increase every few years, as you switch companies? Or do you max out at like 120k for most accountants?

Credit Card Payoff Amount / Interest Calculation,"I accidentally missed a payment on my credit card because I selected the wrong payee in my online banking, and didn't caught on until I saw the credit on my other card. First thing I did was immediately make a payment and a few dollars to cover for the interest so I had a positive balance, but I still ended up with an interest charge on the new statement.  
  
My question is, how do I calculate the exact amount I need to cover the full amount including anymore new interest charge? I found something about calling the card issuer and getting the payoff balance, but that seemed like an American term.

And when exactly does the interest stop, i.e. do I have to pay the card to a credit balance and stop using the card altogether for a whole month before I can go back to paying it off each statement with zero interest?

Rookie Question on ‘’Overvalued’’ Markets,"Hi All,

I recently became interested in investing and been trying to learn as much as possible, as quickly as possible. Crazy how that stuff is barely even taught in business school. 

I’ve been reading about how the market is currently overvalued.

Hoping someone can help me understand.. if I’m looking to invest around 10K in a few ETFs through my TFSA, and the current prices are at the highest they have been in years, is it still a good strategy to start investing now? Or is it safe to expect a market correction in a relatively near future that is worth waiting for?

Assuming my goals aren’t to cash out any of it for at least the next 5-10 years, and I’m looking to keep investing a fraction of all of my paychecks going forward

DIY Investing - Is it worth it? How much time do you spend on your portfolio?,"I recently came into a big chunk of money from a real estate sale that I don't plan on reinvesting in the market (I don't plan on living in Canada longterm, only the next 5-10 yrs)  
I use Wealthsimple Trade for very novice investing and learning for ETFs, US/CDN stocks and crypto (no more than $10K so far) and I use Wealthsimple for my moderate risk managed RRSPS.   
I've been happy with it, but the thought of managing $300k myself seems daunting.   
I'm speaking to a financial advisor at my big bank just to see what they could potentially do for me, and I have feelers out to some independent investment advisors to learn more.    
My question is... how much time do you spend on your portfolio if you are taking care of it yourself? Is the cost of time for researching and keeping up to date with news and emerging trends worth it vs. the fee you would pay?

Return on RBC Rewards+ Visa vs. RBC Cash Back Mastercard?,"I'm trying to figure out which of these two credit cards offered by RBC — the Rewards+ Visa and the Cash Back Mastercard — would provide the best bang for my buck in terms of return (either in what you can buy with RBC Rewards points or in the amount of cash you get back annually).

As far as I can tell, the Cash Back Mastercard could give you up to $120 cash back per year for groceries if you spend about $500 per month ($6000 a year), and an additional $60 (1%) if you spend $500 per month in other categories. Not sure how to determine the value of the RBC Rewards, it's 1 RBC Rewards point for every $1 spent on gas, grocery and drug store purchases and 1 point for every $2 on all other purchases. There are some of the rewards we can use (e.g. Amazon Prime vouchers), but cash is of course always nice.",6,1610407359.0,2021,2021-01-11,Credit,grillboss,8,kvewbp

Having a Roommate and Law/Taxes (Ontario),"So I often hear about the issues of being a landlord/tenant on here, and about home ownership in general, but I have never seen one about having a roommate while being an owner of the apartment.

So my situation is this:

\- Live in Ontario

\- Plan on owning a condo soon

\- Plan to live in it, but would also want a roommate to bring costs down. I might not know the person.

How do taxes and laws function here? Initial digging didn't give me much, so I thought I would ask people on here and perhaps hear some personal experiences.

1) Would the roommate and I have to have a landlord/tenant agreement? If so, does that limit my ability to do what I want in the apartment?

2) I know that there are extra costs added to buying an apartment if I don't live in it. What if I plan on living it it, but have a roommate?

3) Is there anything else I should know about?",4,1610404372.0,2021,2021-01-11,,ExcellentPartyOnDude,1,kvdx1o

Has attitude/advice toward emergency fund changed?,"This is partly a general poll and partly a request for opinions on my own situation. 

Has anyones sentiment toward an emergency fund changed given the current financial climate with dirt cheap credit and the fact money sitting as cash will just lose value over time now, with no safe savings vehicle available to keep up with inflation?

Obviously this doesn’t apply to everyone, but in my situation I question having that much cash just sitting there.

Married, 1 kid, own home with mtg, approx 50% LTV, set up such that it’s paid off the year I’m eligible to retire without penalty.
10k emergency fund, which would be a THIN 3 month fund. 
Both wife and I have very secure govt employment, with the benefits/coordinated benefits and leaves that come with it... so financial risk from extended leave from work or injury requiring treatment is minimal. Risk of loss of employment is near zero.

We do have a dog, and he has hammered us for a $4k surgery before (fluke accident, not illness)


We also have a $115k HELOC at 2.84% with a zero balance... if I ever needed $10k for an emergency... it’d cost me like $24/month to have... which I really couldn’t care about if an emergency arose that required $10k...

With our HHI, we could pay it back fairly quickly. Definitely inside of a year...

Given the above... I keep looking at that money thinking how much better it could be put to use on home improvements or invested or something other than sitting there...

Am I wrong? Missing something? Anyone else pared back their emergency fund for similar reasons?",7,1610402824.0,2021,2021-01-11,,BillStearn,3,kvded0

Can we afford this house?,"We're shopping for a house in NL with my spouse, and have found one that checks all the boxes, but are not quite sure if we would end up house poor. Hoping to get some opinions on our situation.

He will eventually go back to work but his earning potential isn't very high without additional schooling. I'm a software developer working remotely for a company on the mainland, my position feels stable and the company is doing well.
* House cost: Listed for $550k, realtor thinks we could get it for 5% under asking
* Downpayment: $40k, could stretch to $50k if needed
* Savings: $85k cash right now plus a few more thousand at the time of purchase (includes downpayment savings)
* Investments: about $40-50k split between RRSPs/TFSAs/RESP, not planning on touching these in the near future
* One car, 2017 SUV, fully paid off. This house is centrally located so we wouldn't need another car any time soon.
* No other debt
* One child, hopefully another within the next 1.5 years. I will get a company top up to 100% of my salary during maternity leave.
* Looking for a larger house that could also accommodate my MIL in the next few years
* Our lifestyle is pretty low key, we don't have any expensive hobbies or habits
* Only other notable recurring expense will be annual trips to see my family overseas. Estimating about $5k/trip for a family of four.
* The house has had many renovations like a new roof, added insulation and new mini split heat pumps before going on the market, so it shouldn't need any major work in the next few years at least

Tax debt + student loans?,"Hoping for a few people who’ve come across my situation: 

As a (previously) self-employed person, I managed to accumulate a fair bit of income tax debt. Let’s call it around $10 grand. After avoiding the issue for a few years, I had finally made a payment plan with CRA, and had been making regular payments for a couple years, when covid hit.

I lost my means of self-employment AND my backup employment (restaurant industry), and was forced to move away from toronto (back home) to decrease expenses. I also stopped making payments at that time. The only income I currently have is CERB/EI.

I want to go back to school to train for a different industry that won’t become obsolete! My question is, will the government give student loans to someone who owes tax debt?

It’s tricky, I’d love to pay off my debt, but I can’t do that without income, and the industries in which I have put all my time and training have basically collapsed. The loan would be paying for a very affordable two-year college degree- and I’d be very employable after I was done!

Reassessed and refiling; should I pay CRA and agencies in the meantime or wait?,"I filed my 2019 return via Simpletax back in April, got my refund, carried on with life. 

CRA dropped me a note on Christmas Eve with a reassessment and bill for more than $3000. Turns out I missed a T4. Totally my fault for not triple-checking.

The CRA bill was soon followed by notices about the GST and OTB credits. Total for all three is about $5000, and I'm not sure which others will pop up as the reassessment data disseminates.

So I went back into Simpletax and re-scraped CRA to add the missing T4.

But by Simpletax's math, my refund actually goes *UP*. I haven't considered what the new figures will do to GST & OTB eligibility, because I generally apply for whatever's up for applying for, and I'm grateful if I get something.

I used Simpletax to ReFile and await the outcome.

Meantime, what's the recommended strategy for these bills? Pay them now to avoid further interest and penalties, just in case my re-re-assessment fails? Put off paying them until CRA chews through the reassessment, and take my chances? Pay some but not all? 

If looking ahead to the 2020 tax scenario matters to the decision tree, I made a whole lot less money in the plague year, dropping from FT career in 2019 to PT 10 hours a week in 2020, so I anticipate qualifying for whatever people who don't make much money qualify for.

First-time investing - need your advice,"Hi r/PersonalFinanceCanada!

I am looking for some help in how to start investing my money. 

As embarrassing as this is to say, I have never invested in the market in my 30 years of life on this planet. I have an okay amount of savings and my situation hasn't been dire - I just hate that the money I have in my savings account is just sitting there, collecting a few pennies now and then. I feel like if I paid a little more attention, I could make it useful. 

I was never raised with financial literacy, & wouldn't know the first thing about what to invest in, how, RRSPs, TFSAs, etc. I essentially just need a nudge in a safe direction.

A little bit about me & my family:

\- young professional couple, coming from working class families, no kids (yet), we have been lucky to keep our jobs working from home throughout the pandemic.

\- we share our finances in a joint account. Have 1 credit card ($1,500 balance on it currently). We bring home 200K/year together. Currently have 30K sitting in savings, with another 10K in checking (we use this for our day-to-day expenses).

\- we are closing on our first house in QC, 150K down (a bit more than 30%). We get possession end of March, our monthly total expenses will be around $2,700 for everything included.

\- we have 9K left in car payments that we are keeping active to increase credit score, but this can also be paid off if that's the better option for us.

\- we have no other debts besides the new mortgage on the house now.

We both come from working class families & have worked very hard for the past few years to make this happen, saving a huge chunk of our income and generally living pretty simply. We have been renting up until now, so finally taking the step towards having our own property feels very relieving. We are planning on starting a family sometime this year or next, so would like to plan accordingly. 

As I mentioned, we have not yet opened RRSPs, haven't contributed to any TFSAs and are generally just looking to see what we should get started with first & what is most important.

Can't Find Decent Short-Term Cash Holdings Options: pay off HELOC instead?,"Refinanced TO home in April 2020 to replace mortgage with HELOC @ 2.45%. Balance currently sits at apx 6% of home value because our remaining principle was really low.

Fast forward to now, with COVID savings has been decent and have some GICs maturing in my TFSA next month and will have enough cash to pay off said HELOC and still have enough cash for a healthy emergency fund.

Trying to find somewhere to park cash for 1-2 years in hope to go house hunting for a bigger place.

Can't get EQ Bank on the phone to open a TFSA with their wild 2.3% interest to park the cash.

Am I crazy or missing something but can I not just put the cash into the HELOC, stop paying the 2.45% interest on the HELOC, and just borrow against it if/when we can/want to go house hunting in 1-2 years?

Breaking Up With Common Law Partner - Quebec,"Hello!

I am in the processes of breaking up with my common law partner of 5 years. 

We have no kids.

We bought a home about 8 months ago (... I know...) and we split it 2/3 with myself paying a bit over 66% of the down payment. 

I also pay over half the mortgage and all taxes and bills for the home. 

We have not started working on the details, but I am fairly confident the process will NOT be made easy on me and she will fight me to both keep paying for the house, while still living in it. I know its not legally possible but its just how she will play it for the beginning. 

What do I need to do on my end to quickly finish the sale of the home even besides her objections? If thats not possible what else can I do? 

I am currently living in a hotel so would love to get this cleared and behind me as soon as possible.",32,1610390965.0,2021,2021-01-11,,pitchko,21,kv93b8

Saving for kid's College/University,"Hi financial people of Reddit!

I'm looking for some insight.

SOME BACKGROUND: I want to start saving more seriously for my kid's education, I have a little bit set aside in am RESP which is invested mostly in ETFs. I hadn't been able to put much aside previously because I was a single mom and was putting myself through school but I've been working for a little over a year now and am secure and seeing growth in my career. Because of this, I feel like it's a good time to start putting more consistent money aside, earlier I do this the easier it is right?

She's 4 right now and I have about $1500.

QUESTION : is there a reliable way to estimate the cost of tuition in about 14 years? I want to set aside enough so that she has the freedom to choose what kind of education she wants. Equally, is it best to invest in an RESP to get the government grants and also a seperate fund in case she decides not to do traditional education? All RESP? 

I can calculate monthly contributions based on an end goal but I don't want to underfund her education, I want to save her some of the financial stresses I had with trying to get my career started/an education.

TIA!!

[HELP] I have multiple years of back taxes to file and I can't get through to the CRA...,"Hi there, 

First off.... I know they are busy... Covid... Yadayada.. 

However... This is getting out of hand. 

I have been calling every  1-800 number I can find on the CRA website.. and no matter what I do I can't seem to speak to a human. 

I have 8+ years of back taxes to do... I have lived at the same address for 25 years... Never once have I recieved a phonecall, or a letter in regards to my taxes. I have had $20 extra dollars taken off my paycheck since I was 20. (I'm 43 now). 

I have been trying to get help with this for a couple years now. However everytime I try I get so discouraged and just give up... Hence the 8+ years. It also doesn't help that 2 springs ago my home was flooded and I lost almost all of my paperwork. 

Regardless, my mother is getting old.   I finally have my act together and a great paying job.. my mother is getting on in age.. and I would really like to look Into a home that I can build a care suite in and take care of her. 

So... This brings me to quick tax.. filled it out.. it found me.. calculated all my info instantly, showed me my return, linked to my bank account.. the ONLY thing I'm missing is my CRA login information. When I go to log in (on the CRA website) it says 'error contact us for help'.. when I go to register a new number.. it says 'error, contact us for help'.

I've collected EI

I've collected CERB

I've collected works compensation

I just applied and recieved a brand new credit card x2

None of these have ever even flinched about my taxes, or CRA number. 

I've tried to call almost every 1-800 number on the CRA website and all of them either put you in a I finite loop you can't get out of... Or the worst one is after about 12 mins of menu surfing and making you verify you SIN a couple times... The lady says 'please hold, we're sorry all of our agents are busy.. call back later..' and hangs up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm almost in tears... This is the last facet of my old shitty life I need to get shored away.. and here I am again... About to have a breakdown and give up for yet another year.. 

I'm sorry, I never recieved any financial training as a young person.. and I'm only learning now.. I realize I could have avoided all of this by doing it right the first time... But like I said, nobody ever talked to me about it..  and now I'm scared someone is going to genuinely think I've been doing this on purpose.. and or end up in jail. 

Please, please, someone help me get this CRA number so I don't end up with a heart attack.. 

Thank you for reading this his horribly written panic post written with teary eyes from my phone..

Please...

**Update**

I called my local HnR Block and a little old man answered, I told him my story, mentioned the lady that refused to help me for the last 2 years... And he told me 'yeah, she got fired.. come to my office.'

I drove down on my lunch break.. and in less than 3 minutes he looks up at me and says ""I just filed your 2019 tax return."" You should have money in your account in the next day or two. 

Then he Informed me that for a few hundred bucks he would get me all caught up and paid out before the end of January!!!

Rookie Question about TFSA about Contribution Room,"Hey PFC folks!

I just have a quick question regarding the TFSA contribution room. For the sake of simplicity lets assume that no contributions have been made and an individual has full contribution room to use in their TFSA ($75,500 as of 2021).

Now lets say they decide to put $10K in stocks into Company A and it grows to $20K. They decide to sell all of their stocks in Company A. They now have $20K in cash - they now decide to put $10K into their bank and use the remainder $10K to invest in Company B in stocks.   


Question. Are they still just at $10K of contributions so far since all they did was buy Stocks from Company A at 10K  then use the same 10K to buy stocks in Company B?  So basically $75,500 - $10K= $65,500 contribution room left or are they at $75,500 - $20K = $55,500 contribution room left?

"(QC)Financed car, still 4 years on it, want to get rid of it as it’s just sitting there. Any advice ?","Hello everyone,

Normally a lurker in this sub but I’m in need of some advice, if possible, on my situation.

I have a 2017 Honda Civic that I financed in 2018 when my other car just broke down and I was in need of a car. At the time, I still had bankruptcy showing on my credit report from a couple of years before and didn't have money to just buy upfront an old car. So you can guess that my interest rate is REALLY not optimal but it’s the best I could get (13%, some wanted to give me 18% lol). I know its a big mistake but I wasn’t as aware financially back then as I am now. The car was 22k plus tax and all the other fees, which came to about 30k (yep, I know.)

Anyways, now my bankruptcy is gone since September (although TransUnion still hasn't removed it ?) as it has been 6 years after the discharge date. I still owe 23k on the car for another 4 years and a couple months. I would really like to get rid of it and buy an old used car, especially since COVID I’m working from home so the car is just sitting there. I tried to see how much a dealer would buy my car for and the amount I was told was 12.5k, so not enough to sell it.

I was thinking of maybe selling it for the 12.5k and ask my bank for a loan for the remainder to pay the entire car, I’d just need to pay the bank a lesser amount (11k) with a probably better interest rate. That way I wouldn’t pay the 245$ bi-weekly that I’m paying right now. 

Other than that, I have no idea what I could do to get out of that situation, any ideas ? Don’t know much about how refinancing works and bankruptcy and consumer proposal are not things that I would do. I can still pay it, but I dont want to, I want to put money in savings as I can’t at the moment. Covid and the death of my father (no savings) opened my eyes.

Any help appreciated, no judgment please and thank you.

Suggestion - To sell or not,"Hello, I am looking for an advice. I think I know the answer but I need more clarification and a good sense of direction for our future.

We currently live in a townhouse in GTA. Our 5 years mortgage term will end in summer this year. We are a family of 3 (me, husband and a toddler). Our home equity is around 250k. We have some debts too and we are trying to pay it off in next 2-3 months.

Now, my question is I want to get a semi-detached house (to have bigger house than we have) because even semi-detached is $1.2mils (minimum) in our area and I am afraid we will not be able to afford  it in future as prices never seem to go down!!! I don't have 200k for down payment either.  We have a total household income $180k. Initially when we had this townhouse we were dealing with debts and basically we were living as a house poor. Thanks to PersonalfinanceCanada we started making a budget, paying off debts, high interest credit cards. Now we are more disciplined financially.  We budget everything and our savings go to debts payment strictly.

My question is should we sell this townhouse and get a semi or wait until we are financially more stable? I don't want to live in a stress and become a house poor (stressful) again. We clearly don't have enough for down payment. Even we sell this townhouse first and have money for down payment. I am afraid prices will go in that time. Should we get another 1-2 years term to save enough for our next house. I don't know if prices will hit $1.8mils that time (who knows?). It will be more harder to pay that much mortgage monthly compared to now ($1.2mils).

We need around 220k for new mortgage ($1.2mils) and in few years it will be around 360k (for $1.8mils) or something.

I am happy where we are living (community/school) and thankful too. But to think of future, I just want to make sure we take right action at right time.",8,1610379990.0,2021,2021-01-11,Housing,KlutzyCoach,0,kv563b

should i incorporate myself; best way to buy shares in a small company?,"I joined a small start up about a year ago to ultimately gain 20% ownership. It's time for me to purchase the shares, and I'm curious about a few things I was hoping to get some advice on. 

The capital gains tax if/when we sell the company will be based on some kind of formula I haven't fully wrapped my head around. I can set whatever price I'm paying for share, but I've heard that there are some prices that make it better for when you sell, and reduces your capital gains tax? f I'm paying 0.01 a share, and the company is worth 1 million, and sells for 2 million... tbh I haven't figured out how much tax I'd pay but wealthsimple was the most helpful by breaking it down by this:

>In Canada, 50% of the value of any capital gains are taxable. Should you sell the investments at a higher price than you paid (realized capital gain) — you'll need to add 50% of the capital gain to your income. This means the amount of additional tax you actually pay will vary depending on how much you're making and what other sources of income you have.

So if the sale is for 2 million and I get 400k from that, I'm taxed on 200k? What if my purchase price is higher, 10$ per share... any thoughts?

&#x200B;

The second thing is...which I was thinking would help answer the first... should I just incorporate myself and purchase my 20% through a business? That way my taxes would be lower altogether. Hand in hand with this, could that mean I can be paid my bi-weekly salary as a business as well (or contractor I guess?) which would further lower my taxes. 

&#x200B;

Has anyone done any of this before? Any thoughts at all would be super helpful! Thanks in advance!",2,1610379589.0,2021,2021-01-11,,juxy15,0,kv51b7

Rental property vs. Stocks/Reits,"Here is my scenario:

I own a multi unit residential in the 905. Live in a portion and rent a portion to tenants. 

In the process of purchasing a house in the 416. 

Wondering if I should keep the rental in 905 or sell it and put the money in stocks/reits.  

Background info:

- Employee pension, tfsa, rrsp all maxed and in etfs. 
- any further investments would be in taxable accounts. 
- i am in my early 30s. Stable income. Ontario. 

Things to consider:

- i am worried about not being able to evict bad tenants in the covid market. 
- if I sell the 905 house while its my primary residence, I will avoid capital gains taxes.

What is the end Game of Toronto and Vancouver Real estate prices?,"I want to hear your thoughts at how this price appreciation trend goes in 5 to 10 years.

As I observe house prices steadily increasing in 2 of the largest markets in Canada where wages have not kept up, what is the end game?

Before I could kind of understand that there was wiggle room as interest rates could be lowered, but now where is the money that will fuel the future Real Estate transactions.

Where will the wiggle room be for prices to go up even more? I kind of get it that parental help is now crucial for Millennial Canadians to get a leg up and maybe afford a 2 bed condo in the GTA or lower mainland, and for older millennials, they use the price appreciation of their starter condo to fuel the purchase of their town home or house. Now that the burbs are catching up with the prices in the GTA and Vancouver, how do working couples(new immigrants or not) with average or slightly above average incomes without a family windfall get their foot in the market? These are the families that will need to be able to afford the starter condos in order for the condo owners to be able to afford a bigger place.

What will happen at a societal level where let’s say a decently paid worker without an inheritance or substantial savings cannot afford to become a homeowner? Will there be huge demands from Gen Z workers for higher wages, or will companies slowly start leaving the two largest markers? Will wealthy immigrants fill in the void as locals without savings become priced out? I know of a few foreign students with whom I studied that from their perspective that real estate here is really cheap (Canadian dollar is much lower than US dollar) and when generally compared to Chinese cities, Canada is safer and cleaner (their words not mine).

Will we suffer a price crash like in the 90s or will Toronto become more like Hong Kong and New York or other global cities where renting becomes the norm and Canadians need to figure out their retirement without seeing having property to their name?

I am asking just to see what your educated guesses are. I thought Covid of all events would in theory depress prices, but I see now that real estate is really resilient to price pressure.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Update: I love the thoughtful responses. Lots to think about.

I wanted to also ask, what happens to condo prices as generally there is a significant condo fee appreciation year on year. What happens to glass tower condo prices when the glass siding reaches end of life? Do you see prices declining as the fees gobble up potential mortgage payments from new buyers? Are condo purchases a game of musical chairs where one wants to stay in one until major repairs are required for the building and then the prices for those condos declines?

Update2: Now that we have  an explosion in bidding wars and increased prices all over Ontario and Lower Mainland in 2021, do you see this trend become a catalyst for Canadians to move to Alberta and other provinces? Toronto did see a net 50 000 migration out of the city in 2020.",132,1610377523.0,2021,2021-01-11,Housing,putnik29,15,kv4dfi

Burning out while barely holding it together,"Hi guys,

As the title suggests, I'm having some major problems with job burnout. I've managed to get my life expenses down to $24,000 per year, but I'm very behind on saving for retirement. I've finally got my debts paid off. Working on the emergency fund and then on to investing. A huge chunk of my income is going towards savings. I've also got a lot of pressing home renovations coming up, and my 18 year old car could bite the dust any day now and I don't have a car fund saved up. My plan for that would be to save around $7K and buy something used but reliable. I also have to contribute a good chunk to my ex wife.

Right now, I am holding the fort and making progress. I'm very lucky to have a job that lets me work as much paid overtime as I want. On top of that, we are insanely busy right now and growing more than we ever have before. Currently I am working 60+ hours every single week, often 70+. I often work 7 days a week, under high pressure since we have so much to do and so little time.

Problem is, I'm super burnt out. My sleep schedule is all messed up, I'm suffering panic attacks all the time, I had a mental breakdown a few months ago, and I am having crying fits a lot which is really unusual for me. However I do get to work from home during the pandemic which is a big plus since my commute is very long. They're pressuring me hard to go back into the office though. 

I hadn't taken a vacation in 2 years and decided it was time. So, I took almost 2 weeks off at Christmas. I have been looking forward to that all year. Well, Christmas vacation came and went, and it was a disaster. On top of family issues and isolation issues, the pressure to get the most of it got to me and I struggled harshly with mental health during the time off. Now the vacation is over, and it didn't actually help at all with the burnout. Furthermore, now I'm faced with the daunting reality that it will likely be another year before I can try again for time off.

I have strongly considered changing jobs, trying to find an option that pays the same amount per year, but with a more normal amount of work. Unfortunately, that hasn't been working out so well. I've been submitting applications for a year, but haven't heard back from a single one. Even if I did, I'm not sure that I'd be able to get a significant pay bump. I've spent years negotiating with my work's management and was able to secure a pretty nice pay bump a year ago. I'm already paid decently for what I do. 

I'm just feeling so trapped and so tired all the time. I've even considered just giving up on saving for retirement, so that I can live a less stressful life for a bit. 

I don't have value outside of my job right now. I just work and exist.

I'm tired.

Any advice?

Please.

Thank you.",38,1610369772.0,2021,2021-01-11,,Bigmacpaddywack,21,kv23lt

Thoughts/advice on TD bank frauds? Seems super common these days,"
 Sorry for long read but I just want to be as detailed as possible to get some advice. 

My ex husband has recently had his online account with TD bank hacked. He woke up to emails of security notifications from TD, first of password change and then (his) phone number removal, and then face id and the hackers phone number activated. While this is all happening his email was also being used to sign up for a crap ton of random sites, most of which were “requesting confirmation of subscription” with a link. Apparently the hacker had changed his password and phone number with TD but not his email, and was able to do so by simply logging in with the password. Ex was unable to reset his password as the security code was being sent to the hacker’s phone number. What’s weirder is that his TD password is the same as his email, so why not hack the email as well? Or did they already hack the email but didn’t leave evidence? 

TD was useless. They were able to tell him that they blocked his account but not much else. Apparently the hacker tried to deposit money and withdraw a larger amount, as well as moved his cc funds to his debit to withdraw it. Some rep randomly speculated that it could have been for crypto. Good thing is police is investigating as it’s theft over $3000. Bad news this may be far from a one time thing, and ex keeps denying that he’s used his card/info anywhere suspicious so it’s very hard to help track down the source of the problem.


I’ve read other posts where the hacker continued to have access to the account despite password/card change due to the hacker activating fingerprint log in on unknown device and there was no way for the account holder to turn it off. What if hacker can still log in with face id after all this us “resolved”? Also even if he got a new card, wouldn’t the hacker still be able to take out pre auth payments since he has the account info? Also, while I was helping him change his passwords and check logged in devices, he was changing his password on his laptop while I was checking his spam emails on my laptop, however his hotmail only showed one logged in device—his laptop. Can a hacker do this? Or was it just a glitch?? This only happened to his hotmail, and didn’t happen with his google account (which is not connected to TD. 

At first I was fairly certain I knew what happened—ex signed up and paid for a dating site, the hacker actually had his info for a while (and has actually charged his card before, though ex denies it all when I tried to tell him) and has now just gotten around to screwing with his account. 

The day after his scam, I got a text that said “Dear [full name] You have a notice regarding(472409****) : https://esyweb-notice.info” I knew it was a scam bc I have auto deposit. What has me worried is that it included my full legal name (which no one knows and I never use unless it was something I need to verify with government ID), was sent to my actual phone number (I always use TextMe numbers) and it knew I have an account with TD.. I can’t figure out anywhere this info would have come from and I’m nervous. Not that I have money to steal but damn I really don’t want this happening to me.

TDLR: Ex got their TD account hacked, password and phone number changed, face id activated, account blocked. TD was not very helpful. Any insights on what happens now? Also now I’m getting phishing messages I’ve never gotten before, with my full name and my bank to my phone number. Could it possibly be caused by his account being hacked, and how?",17,1610344812.0,2021,2021-01-11,,_feelslikesummer,1,kuwm9q

Help understanding insurance?,"Hi everyone,

So here's the deal, my dad owns two cars (Cars A and B) and my sister owns another (Car C). We all live under one house. My dad has his own policy where he is primary on one and I'm primary on the other. My sister has his own policy where she is primary on her car. Both policies are with the same insurance company.

My delimma is that I'm driving 100+ km for work everyday, and the car I'm currently using (Car B) is old, unreliable, and hogs gas like anything. My sister works from home with a decent car so I figure, I might as well use hers and shes cool with that. But I'm not sure if changes are required to either insurance policy. I'm under the impression that in Canada the insurance is per person, not per car. That is to say, as long as I'm primary on either of the three cars and am paying for insurance I should be fine to drive her car, Car C. Is this correct?

Now I've talked to two agents, and I'll call a third tomorrow but honestly it would be great to grab from others experiences. So the first agent said, no changes need to be made because we all live under the same household. Thats where my previous comment comes from. However, after calling again to confirm, the second agent was very by the book and just said she doesn't know about these things, call a different department.

How Should I Invest Moving Forward?,"In my late teens, the money I saved was put into a mutual fund or GIC. That was the advice I received from my financial advisor. It was a small sum of money, but it wasn’t until I began to research investing that I realized why they “advised” me to take their suggestion(s). Once they matured, I opened up a TFSA investment account and purchased some ETFs. My investment strategy has been relatively safe over the years, as I have multiple ETFs (VFV, VGRO, VDY, XIC, XEF) in that account.

I have been watching videos related to stock and ETF trading and I would like to be more aggressive in my strategy as I am in my mid-20s and am looking to grow my portfolio.

&amp;amp;lt;10k cash

Liability: mortgages only

Income:
Gross salary: 88000/yr
Rent:28000/yr

Currently on MAT leave, will return to work in Summer

I will have no buffer to save for the next 6 years until my newborn goes to school (no more daycare fees)

Never tried TFSA/RRSP. Only have DCPP from work

Want to try trading (for long term) but don’t have much cash at the moment so I think it will be safer to do TFSA so I can withdraw easily without having to pay tax in case of emergency. 

Thought about max out RRSP to reduce income tax but I need my full income in hand to take care of kid/expenses/basics.

Q1. is opening TFSA on questrade and investing in index-etf really my best option?

Q2. How would you go about investment if you were me? 

Any tips would be greatly appreciated as I’m very new to investments.

EDIT:

Here is a full breakdown of my monthly cashflow:

Net Income 1 (salary)  5000

Net Income 2(rent) 2550

Net Income 3 (may not be stable after a year) 1800

——————————

home insurance: 115

car insurance: 150

condo insurance: 30

Water 60

Hydro 110

Gas + water tank rental 230

House Property tax 440

Internet + cell 230

Life/disability/term/critical illness Insurances: 650

Mortgage on 850k home:  2450

Mortgage on 1M rental: 1650

Condo fee: 600

Daycare: 1800

————————

9350(income)-8515(expenses)=835

I only have 835 to spend on food/savings every month.
I’m a single mom in early 30’s so I cannot reduce my insurance in case something happens to me. My insurances guarantee ~2M for my kid when I die. 

Also some of my insurances mature in 30 years and I will get ~500k. 

Plus I’m in the process of getting my inheritance (~500k) which will take 2-5 years. These are the reasons I am not so worried about my retirement funds. 

I think I need to focus more on how to survive until my kid turns 6, school age

***24 years old.***

Total income (FT job + 2-3 small secondary streams) is about 65K gross (comms/marketing).

Net worth right now is sitting \~65K. Rent is $1,100/mth in downtown Toronto core (sacrificing comfort for economic sense). Very lucky to have no debt, and the only notable payments I have are car+insurance of approx. $600/mth.

Right now: 20K in regular chequing, 8K in non-registered direct investing account (in process of draining and moving to Questrade TFSA), 12K in an RRSP (Canadian ETFs).

Transferred my TFSA from main bank to Questrade in November, and that's \~28k largely in American blue chips with a few CAD-hedged ETFs from Vanguard.

"After 10 months of not paying rent, I finally had my tenant arrested!!!","last month I wrote a post about how a deadbeat scammed me using forged documents and stopped paying rent/utility since March 2020, using COVID as an excuse. The post got a lot of attention and made to the top of this subreddit. I want to give you guys an update on the situation. 

(Original Post is here)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/ken35m/i\_see\_a\_lot\_of\_young\_people\_want\_to\_invest\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/ken35m/i_see_a_lot_of_young_people_want_to_invest_in/)

I want this to be an educational post for landlords/potential landlords. I hope you can learn from my mistakes. **Personal Finance** is not just about wealth accumulation, it's also about wealth protection. 

&#x200B;

**Background:**

you can read the original post for back story. 

**Current situation:**

After the online tribunal with the landlord tenant board, I received an eviction order (adjudicator give this deadbeat another 20 days to move). I was prepared for him to disobey the eviction order and have the sheriff come to throw him out (on average it takes sheriffs three weeks after eviction order date) ... but then... bamm... he was **ARRESTED** by the police for fraud ... Six month after I filed fraud report, police finally decided to move on him . They went to his house couple times first (he didn't open the door). The police left a note on his door requesting him to go to the police station and explain himself, which he refused to do (maybe he thought this would go away somehow). Police then applied for an arrest warrant and they finally arrested this deadbeat last week!!! I am not sure what the next step would be but lets hope he is charged. On a side note, I want to write something about the law enforcement... when I first got in contact with the fraud investigator, he told me that it's a very tricky situation, because even the deadbeat is arrested and charged, he technically can not be evicted because only LTB can end a tenancy. The investigator even told me ""I will arrest the guy and ask him to leave your property ""voluntarily"" because the SYSTEM has failed you""... this is the sentiment I get when I spoke the police officers, the Ombudsman's office, even staffs from LTB... they all recognize how absurd the laws are in place... People are refusing to pay and nothing can be done about it. 

One positive thing about the arrest is that he became much more compliant and even told me he was ready to find a new place and he would move out soon \~\~

Then, last week, I received a call from an unknown number asking if I am the owner of 1234 Happy Boulevard (my rental property) ... at first I was a little puzzled, then the caller said he received a rental application from XXX and he found some abnormalities in his application, he took the initiative and found my old rental ad and my phone number. I told him the truth\~ and he thanked me for it... however, all this deadbeat had to do is to find one landlord who fail to do due dilligence and he gets to live rent free for another year or two, rinse and repeat ... Judging by the fact that he moved out today, he  already found his next victim

**Conclusion/Lessons:**

1. if you are thinking about becoming a landlord in Canada or anywhere in North America, think twice! The laws are heavily favouring the tenants. On average, it takes 6-9 months to evict a non-paying deadbeat (before COVID). Right now, we are looking at between 1-2 years during COVID. I suspect people who filed eviction request later this year will have a non-paying deadbeat for at least another year..... I submitted a L1 (eviction hearing request for non-payment) in April 2020. No one has reviewed my application yet. The eviction blitz you are hearing on the news\~ these are deadbeats from before COVID. I know someone who filed in Jan 2020 and still can't get a hearing scheduled
2. It's better to leave your place vacant than renting to someone who isn't an ideal tenant.  
3. It's better to leave your place vacant than renting to someone who isn't an ideal tenant.  
4. It's better to leave your place vacant than renting to someone who isn't an ideal tenant.  I wrote this three times because it is so so important. The law does not protect you. You must protect yourself
5. learn the system, use the resource that are available out there, even if they are not ideal\~. Even though I knew the police did not have the authority to evict him, I still insisted that a police case must be raised as I needed it to file an urgent hearing request with the Landlord Tenant Board
6. there are no failure, only life lessons. we are all human, we make mistakes. I know it's easy to feel down and blame yourself for making mistakes, but learn from it and don't make the same mistake again. You learn more from mistakes than success. 

Feel free to ask me any question you have about eviction. I think I am pretty knowledgeable on this subject now",607,1610333151.0,2021,2021-01-10,,AmazingGrace987,1098,kutg0c

Questrade and using the RRSP HBP for offer deposit,"Hey all, 

Looks like I'm about to put an offer on a property in the GTA. Upon acceptance of the offer, I have to submit 5% of the purchase price as a deposit within 24 hours. 

My plan was to utilize the RRSP HBP for this purchase. My RRSP is with questrade, and tomorrow 35k worth of my ETFs will be liquidated into cash. 

The deposit can be submitted via bank draft, direct bank transfer or wire transfer. My agent recommends that I move my funds to my normal bank account first but I'm a bit confused as it seems to conflict with the requirements of the HBP which requires you to fill out the form with the address of the place you are purchasing. I can't necessarily do this because the offer hasn't been accepted yet. Questrade also gives a 1-3 day range for transfer processing times. 

Can anyone shed some guidance?

"Recently got into investing, think I already made a mistake...","Hi PFC! 

I am a 22M engineering student and soon graduating this coming term. Up until now I only invested in GICs (TFSA) only because I was not willing to take on many risks as a student and I am not well versed in finance and didn't have the time to look into it. I have now gotten serious about investing in stocks as a goal for myself in the new year, so I visited my bank to get advice on growing the money I saved from my internships.

I told them my plans for the future (i.e. purchase RE, pay of student loans, etc.). The investment consultant told me not to pay off my student loans in full and just pay it off slowly since the interest rate is low, while using the money I saved to invest on better things. Everything made sense and before I knew it, they wrote up a plan for me and signed me up for CIBC Smart Balanced Growth Solution (TFSA), Balanced Growth Solution (Non Reg) and Investors Edge. I thought they had made a good plan for me as a starting point, and I was more inclined to go with a professionally managed portfolio as a beginner (Also I don't have much time while studying to actively look at my finances). I also didn't want money just sitting there doing nothing.

That same night I did research on personal finance and landed up on this sub and learned a lot from posts and what other people are doing. Firstly, I didn't realize just how financially illiterate I was. Secondly, it seems like the consensus here is that the big bank products don't look for my best interests because of the MER fees and that the advisors are just sales people. It feels like I made a mistake buying into their products and the questions that are in my head are:

1. Were there better options for me given my situation?

She is not required to fill out any paperwork. The software will track her mileage to and from work as well as any driving after work.  How does this work?  On what will her tax liability be based on?,2,1610320677.0,2021,2021-01-10,Auto,newlox,0,kupp7m

"Transferred IG Mutual Funds to Questrade IN KIND without knowing better, am I going to lose big $$...what is the next best move?","I am working to expand my financial literacy, and really have enjoyed the QT platform for the past year.  Recently I made the move (thanks to PFC) to transfer my IG accounts into QT.

Not knowing any better - I made this transfer 'In-Kind' as opposed to 'In Cash' as many suggest.  

Of course, the intent of the move to QT was to reduce MER's and invest in ETF's.  So I have succeeded in moving the funds, but kept the MER's

For numbers, I am looking at about $150k in RRSP, and $250k in a Corporate Margin account still in IG Mutual Funds.

I have reviewed the [QT transaction fees](https://www.questrade.com/pricing/self-directed-commissions-plans-fees/transaction) and it looks like $9.95 per trade.

Does this mean for if I hold 5000 units in IGI1215 for example that if I SELL all 5000 units in one trade it will only cost $9.95??

How does one look into the IG funds to determine if it is Front End, Back End, or No-Load and how would this calculate into my decision when to sell within QT?

I saw one past comment suggesting the IG MER is reduced by 1% or more when transferring out as this no longer goes to the advisor but cannot find any information backing that up. Any sources for that?",6,1610320085.0,2021,2021-01-10,Investing,suddenstop,0,kupig5

First Time Investor - 25 y/o full-time worker,"Hi Everyone,

I've been a lurker of this subreddit for a few months and have found some very beneficial posts with a lot of intelligent individuals with a vast range of experiences. I am a 25 y/o guy making around 55k/year salary with not too many things to pay for. I live with my parents so rent and food is essentially free; unless I decide to splurge on fast food which is a habit I am cutting down on. I pay for my phone bill , car maintenance and repairs & insurance , an apple music family membership ($15/month), and gym membership. 

&#x200B;

I have about $7500 in a moderately high interest Line of credit (15%) with my bank. I am working on aiming for $1000 each pay period to cut down on this which is a bit wishful, but if I am frugal I can manage. I have just recently opened a trading account with Investor's Edge and want to build a great long term portfolio. My question is that what stocks would be good to invest frequently with using CIBC Investor's Edge? It charges me $7/trade which is why I want to be smart with considering that when I am only depositing around $100-250 each paycheque towards my investment portfolio until I pay this debt off.

Edit: General consensus seems to be to pay off debt before I even consider investing. Thank you everyone for the guidance! I will be aggressively knocking this debt away.",8,1610319385.0,2021,2021-01-10,,mrrgill23,2,kupa7i
Mortgages: Pre-approval vs Approvals,"Hi PFC Canada,

As a mortgage broker, I just wanted to clear up the definition of a pre-approval vs an approval for the community as there are lots of posts regarding mortgages, especially with all time low interest rates.

**Pre-approval**: 

Pre-approvals are done prior to having an accepted offer for a property to give clients an estimate of the mortgage they may qualify for.

Depending on the mortgage lender, these are often just calculations based on the information provided by a client as well as their credit bureau.  Most lenders will not fully underwrite (fully review documentation, credit bureau, down payment, etc.) pre-approvals and oftentimes do not even require documents to process a pre-approval for a client.  These are simple calculations meant to give clients a rough estimate of what they may be able to qualify given that the information they have provided is accurate and can be verified once the full application is submitted.

Some lenders (TD, First National, etc.) do fully underwritten pre-approvals, where underwriters will review income documentation, review the credit bureau in depth as well as bank statements for down payment verification.  

**Conditional Approval**: 

Once a mortgage application has been submitted (with all relevant income information, credit bureau, down payment information, purchase contract, etc.) and has been approved by a lender, they will provide a Conditional Approval.

Depending on the lender, they may or may not review the documentation up front in order to provide a commitment letter to the client.  This commitment letter will outline the mortgage terms and rate, monthly payments and most importantly the conditions that are required to obtain a firm approval and funding of the mortgage.

Conditions typically include:

* Income verification (via paystubs, job letters, T4s, Notice of Assessments, T1 Generals, etc)
* Down payment verification (via bank statements, gift letters, etc.)
* Property appraisal (completed via 3rd party certified appraisers)

Keep in mind that as lenders begin to review your documents, they may ask for additional documents in order to move towards the firm approval stage of the mortgage.  Examples of this would be:

* For self-employed clients, lenders may ask for business bank statements and invoices to show that the current year revenue is similar to those of previous years (especially now due to COVID-19)
* To verify overtime/hourly work, lenders may ask for 2 or 3 years T4s and NOAs and may take a 2 or 3 year average of these amounts to use for qualification
* If funds have been moved around for down payment (savings to chequings to investments, etc), additional bank statements may be requested
* For larger gifted down payments, lenders may request the giftor's bank statements to verify the source of the down payment

**Firm Approval:**

Once all the lender conditions have been fulfilled, congratulations! You now have a firm approval and are clear to fund.  Keep in mind that lenders **CAN STILL PULL YOUR APPROVAL AT THIS STAGE.**

Reasons that they may pull an approval include:

* Credit check close to closing shows new liabilities (new car loans/leases are the most common, or new loans, etc with active balances) that cause the clients to no longer qualify
* Suspected fraud (additional verification of documents showed inconsistencies or document fraud)
* Background check of the client (audit or compliance may Google search clients and find that they have previous or current crime backgrounds, etc.)

Hope this helps the community a bit!",130,1610319345.0,2021,2021-01-10,,schenca,365,kup9r0

"[BC] 22 year old Fraser Valleyan, $60000/year income, is buying a house even possible in today's market?","I thought I made a decent wage for my age group, but owning a small studio apartment would almost break the bank. Even rural rundown houses far outside city limits are completely out of any sort of price range for me. The closest property I saw with any sort of affordability was a half-million dollar small decaying crack shack an hour away from my work in a dead end town. Trailer houses still seem ""reasonable"" at only $100,000 average, but for that amount of money 20 years ago you could buy a beachfront property. I'm by far the youngest of my coworkers, most are 40+ and own their own large multi-story suburban houses and have at least reasonable mortgages, yet it looks like I'll be stuck a renter despite us making the same income.

Is this the product of an out of control housing market totally inaccessible to anybody my age who isn't a 1%er, or are my naïve and misunderstanding something or doing something wrong? I feel like I did well for myself, so if I can't afford a house how can anybody my age afford a house? I pay 1/3 of my income monthly to a man who owns 47 other properties throughout my region and makes an estimated $100,000/mo, I think a better investment would be paying a mortgage on property I actually own, but jumping into that seems extremely risky.

Question is: Is it worth trying to escape the renters market these days, is it even possible?

As a genz, buying a house to me always sounded like a crazy pipe dream, like buying a Yacht. I never considered it realistic. But the majority of people in my country in my income bracket own their own homes, so maybe I'm the crazy one.",19,1610317947.0,2021,2021-01-10,Housing,Buck_Jonestown,0,kuotj4
I hate dipping into my emergency account,"Hi all, I'm struggling with my emergency fund.

My car broke down, it's probably going to be 1-2k to fix. I've got the cash (the usual 6 months or so in savings) and I'm going to have to dip in to pay for this. I knew this was coming, I have the money, yet I can't justify it short of ""I have no other option"". Of course I'll put the money back first thing.

I guess this is my first 'emergency', so is it right that it should only be used for 'no other option' scenarios? It's causing me stress, and I guess I'm just looking for justification.

Edit: thanks to everyone who answered. This is what the emergency fund is for, and I'll refill it afterwards. It still sucks that this happened, and having the cash for it doesn't necessarily make all the stress go away. I guess I've never been underwater, so it's hard to see that this is the best case scenario (as opposed to putting it on a card and paying 20% on it), but all in all my life goes on.",23,1610317382.0,2021,2021-01-10,,packocrayons,1,kuom9y

Moving to Canada shortly. Making a list of Finance-related stuff to do. Did I miss anything?,"We are 2 adults and 2 kids. One is turning 15 this year, one is in Primary.

Here’s a list I’ve made of all the things I’ve done or need to do to make a smooth transition related to finances. Please let me know if I'm missing anything or have overlooked any possibilities.

**Before we leave:**

1. I've made US and Canadian accounts at banks that have branches on both sides of the border and a Charles Schwab checking account w/ debit card that returns all atm fees just in case we need CAD (cash) quickly.
2. Signed up for a traveling mailbox service and/or use my relatives address for mail and all financial accounts
3. Switched most clients/tenants to pay electronically via zelle & venmo). If I have a US Google FI phone, Venmo should work, no?
4. Set up a Google Voice # and Google FI services for a US phone number for 2 factor just in case I need it for two-factor authentication (though I've heard Canadian numbers work?)
5. Set up remote access to a relatives computer in the US so I can access financial accounts just in case.
6. Remembering that we need to buy US listed ETFs in Canada when we are ready to start investing there so we dont fall into the PFIC trap.
7. Staying away from TFSAs for now, to keep things simple.
8. Cancelled all credit cards except two: One without a foreign transaction fee, and one  American express to try to do their ‘global’ transfer to a Canadian American express. Hoping its a quick way to build credit on The Canadian side of the border.
9. Bringing our Driver's/Insurance History so we may get a not-so-ridiculous car insurance rate?

**Upon arrival (and after quarantine):**

1. Write an “election” letter to transform our Roth IRAs into a pension for Canadian tax purposes.
2. Register for OHIP
3. Open an Questrade account for purposes of A. Norbert’s Gambit as well as B. Make an RESP for each of our children and immediately put $2K in for each kid (since it'll be the year our elder kid turns 15 we’ll make the cutoff). While we wont get any long term investment returns we should get the 20% gov’t bonus)",13,1610316229.0,2021,2021-01-10,,BrownFolksFIRE,1,kuo7kj

Youngest sibling is milking OSAP with no career goal,"Background, I'm the oldest of 3 siblings. Our parents immigrated to Canada from India in the 90s and we were dirt poor, my father wore the same 5 shirts for as long as i could remember and the only time my mother brought anything was groceries for the family. Life was hard, I went to school with kids that wore Nike and Adidas while my parents still made me wear my cousin's hand me downs from India. I got bullied a lot and that was what motivated me to grind at school so that one day I wouldn't have to deal with this bullshit anymore.

As my parents started saving up we ended up moving to a bigger apartment and later on my 2 siblings were born. My sister (21) and my youngest brother (18), I'm 26 turning 27 in 2021. Now my parents gave me what they could but they were both and still are working minimum wage jobs, my father works 45-50 hours per week while my mother works part time 10-30 hours per week picking up shifts as needed if money gets tight.

I was happy to see my sister and brother growing up better off than myself, my mother actually brought new clothing from the gap or sportschek for them. However, my brother always was the type of person my mother ""babied"". I don't know if being the youngest sibling causes a mother to have a soft heart but I could tell the way our mother raised us were very different.

I graduated with a BComm in 2015 and it took me a few years to find a real job. Currently I'm making 60k/year in a job relevant to my education and I've been with this company for 1 year and I'm sure I'll remain here for the foreseeable future. My current goal is to continue with my career progression and save up for a condo.

My sister is currently working towards her accounting BCom from U of T and I can say she is the smartest out of us 3. The scholarships and bursaries she earned has paid for almost half of her tuition while OSAP is covering the rest and she has been working student jobs with the government every summer since she started this program. 

Sorry for the long background story but I feel it is very relevant to what I'll say about my youngest brother and thank you for reading up until this point and understanding my frustration in this situation.

My brother enrolled in a 2 year business accounting program at Centennial college which he started in September 2020. I just found out my brother failed 3 out of his 6 courses in the semester. Long story short (we had a very long argument about this) he's been placed on some academic plan with a promise to repeat and pass the failed courses. Now during the argument I yelled at my brother that he is wasting our parent's money if he doesn't try hard and my brother's response was ""don't worry fam OSAP pays for school"". I asked him WTF he's talking about because OSAP gives a grant and a loan where the loan still needs to be paid back. My brother told me he got 9k in grant and 3k in loans. Some background about my brother, he has never worked a job in his life, he never did any volunteer hours for high school because his school suspended the program due to the covid pandemic so he was lucky in this case.

I asked my brother what his plan is and he said he wants to continue studying but ""taking it easy while OSAP pays for school"". $11,000 is a lot of money for any teenager but once you hit the real world you'll know it's nothing. My brother has the mindset that he can continue keeping it lax while barely passing classes as OSAP keeps giving him these massive grants. 

Please I need some advice in this situation, I really don't want to bring this up with my parents as I think my brother is still young and hasn't realized how crap of a plan he has for his future. I try telling him that he's better off actually learning something from school and being able to use the experience to get a job that pays $50,000 or more but his attitude towards working hard is very frustrating for me to deal with. He just wants to sit as home and collect money from OSAP while living off of our parents.

What can I do here?

What does your taxable account look like?,"Before I make the plunge into TD e-Series, I want to get a sense of what folks are putting in their non-registered accounts. The relative bookkeeping simplicity of e-Series and the auto-payment feature appeals to me.

If I can retain a lot of money, 100K+, that would be eaten by MER by doing a little more bookkeeping, then I don't mind going the ETF route as opposed to the e-Series route.

I've already read enough to know that I should be avoiding ETFs with DRIP enabled since it's a bookkeeping nightmare. I'm also not so keen on having ETFs that pay dividends because, again, that's extra bookkeeping.

2. Or should I invest in RRSP today and not claim deduction?

The 1 year delay outcome of the spread sheet is as follows:

Taxable account 144,151

RRSP now: 125,185

RRSP delay: 143,535",2,1610306712.0,2021,2021-01-10,,Prize-Dust,2,kukvjy
Put Emergency Funds in VAB or VCB ETF Bond??,"Hi  
Is it a good idea to invest the emergency fund into a VAB or VCB bond? The prices are pretty constant over the past few years and the risk is low and can be encashed anytime.

Company life insurance - how common?,"In 2018 I've started a new job in an investment firm, after 15 years at a different one. Last week I've turned 40 and I was presented with a document offering me a life insurance policy by the company. My wife and I have life insurance and I've never had my previous employer do this (a top 3 investment bank), granted I was younger. 

This is an 8 million policy and I'd be responsible for only 10% of the premium payment, while beneficiary would be entitled to 50% of the payout, with the remaining 50% going to the firm.

Helping family member transfer TFSA from TD to Questrade - want to make sure I am doing it right.,"I've been with Questrade for awhile. Back when I transferred my TFSA, the amount was low enough that I just withdrew the money and then deposited it with QT, as I had ample contribution room.  


My family member has just over $40k in a TFSA in a TD ""High Interest"" Saving Account, and after a quick discussion and some math, we quickly saw how pointless it is to have the money sitting in there.   


I just haven't done a transfer this big before and don't want to mess it up.   


I understand that we trigger the transfer from the Questrade side (I see it's an option in the ""fund account"" section).   


Is there anything we need to be aware of before doing this transfer?   


I understand that QT will rebate the $75 fee that TD charges - how does that happen? How long does it take?   


I feel fairly confident in doing this, but this post is basically me asking ""what might I not know that I don't know?"", and if it doesn't come up with any reasons to be concerned, then I'll proceed.

Mortgage broker not submitting gift letter??,"I was gifted a large amount of money from my parents for my first home down payment. This money has been in the account for around 2 years.

I got the commitment letter from the lender, and it says if any of the down payment is gifted, I must provide a gift letter and any false info will either cancel or delay in this process.

UPS sent me a bill but it was COD,So l ordered something for the US to Can. After l made the purchase l was told about the import fee.

The item was cash on delivery and required a signature. UPS left the item at my door and did not notify me. I found it sitting on the step later that night covered in snow. 1 month later l was sent a bill for the import fees. The only reason l decided to keep the item was because they didn't charge me the cash on delivery...if they had tried then l would have returned it.

Tangerine Index Fund or HISA for 5+ year planning?,"25y/o, about 70k gross annual income. 

I had the Tangerine Equity Growth index fund with Tangerine for \~3 years but recently moved it to their new Equity Growth ETF (had about a 10% return). This is in a TFSA. 

I am planning to buy a house but I don't think it will be for at least another 3-7 years, but I know anything can happen from now and then. I have a high risk tolerance and would like to keep money in the index fund for high returns, as I think I can be flexible with when I will need the money to buy a house. 

My question is: Would you recommend I put some money in a TFSA HISA as well as the index fund given the uncertainty in timeline? I was thinking doing $500/month in the index fund and the rest after expenses can go into EQ's 2.3% TFSA HISA.

How to pay off debt without ruining credit,"Hi everyone, long time lurker, first time poster. I did something years ago that's still haunting me. I bought some furniture from Ashley and was told if I wanted a no payment plan at 0% we would have a year to pay it off. Thinking 0% credit, we signed up.

Long story short - sales rep was not knowledgeable and now my original amount is at $8k as I haven't made payments. It's now 4 years later. 

This is having a very negative impact on my credit report and I would love to clear it up. The advice I was given was that pay it in full as debt is still with fair stone and hopefully my credit will start recovering. 

However, fairstone mentioned it will show up as an R9 on my equifax and will stay on my report for 7 years. Yikes! Is this the best way to improve my credit? A settlement seems to be worse although a consumer proposal only shows up for 3 years.

What should my focus be? Tips? Company matches 20% of stock,"33 years old  
Income: 74k Salary + Bonus/OT = Roughly 85-90k  
Nova Scotia  
Married - spouses makes about $65k   
No kids **but we are hoping to start a family this year.** So things are going to get expensive soon.   


**Investments/Savings/Assets:**

Defined Contribution Pension: 'High Risk' Manulife Avenue Portfolio = $51k  
Group RRSP: 'High Risk' Manulife Avenue Portfolio = $80k  
TFSA: $5k in employer company stock  
$5k in cash/emergency

Currently maxing out Company pension @ 6% company matches another 6% = 12% total  
Only putting in about $2400 a year in my RRSP, mostly to re-pay my first time home buyer loan from 10yrs ago. I've been paying a little more than the minimum. 

My company has a very interesting match. **Each year they will match 20% of a maximum of $20,000 in company stock**. So it's a 'free' $4k -- however the match is counted as income so I get taxed on it. It's a well established blue chip stock w/ dividends. It is purchased at market value. In the past I have borrowed money on credit line to get the match and then sell it to pay it off (no vesting period) -- but they dont like this :) 

I am absolutely nowhere near maxing out my RRSP or TFSA. Most of my money goes to pension. 

**Debts:**

Mortgage 1.5% for 4 years -- owe $199k home worth $300k. 18 years left.  
Just got a flexline/HELOC **have not used it at all yet.** $40k available @ \~3% interest  
$7,000 car loan @ 7.8%  
$10k on spouse credit line @ 7%. Have been aggressively paying it down  


**Questions:**

Wondering if this makes sense: Pay off higher interest car loan and credit line using HELOC @ 3% ... continue aggressively paying them down to 0? use available savings cash/stock to pay off credit line?

....put the focus into the company match stock, and load it into my TFSA to try and get as close to the 20k as possible? Borrow from HELOC if needed to top up to the 20k? Continue putting minimum amount into RRSP for home buyer loan payback. I know you shouldnt put all your eggs into one basket but an instant 20% return is hard to pass up. It's a stable company with several billion in assets.

ELI5: Putting money into ETFs rather than just a HISA,"I've been doing a lot of reading but there are still some basic concepts I don't quite understand. Mind you, I essentially have very little knowledge of personal finances other than sticking my savings into a TFSA or HISA. 

I'm in my early 20s, still live at home, make about 40k before taxes, and I don't have any debt. I don't currently for-see any large expenses any time soon.

I have about 25k just sitting in a chequing account and that's only because it was in a TFSA as cash but I pulled it out before the end of 2020 because I was about to move it to EQ. 

I've been reading about ETFs but I can't quite wrap my head around the concept just yet. HISA is simple.. you give your money to the bank and they give you a bit of interest every month. I don't quite understand how you make money on an ETF. 

Is it basically just like investing in stocks (and I do kind of get that an ETF can be a bunch of different stocks) where you don't actually make anything until you sell them? It's all about potential right? 

I think it's just me trying to picture with all the possible volatility that if I keep this money in an ETF for 20+ years, trying to keep track of whether my initial and ongoing investments is actually making money rather than possibly losing or staying stagnant.

I've taken that vanguard risk assessment questionnaire as well and I would get a 80/20 assessment. Oh and yes, I would plan to use the TFSA contribution room",23,1610296702.0,2021,2021-01-10,Investing,kristenn21,6,kuhp9d

Possibility of refinancing home as a student.,"I bought a condo in Toronto (in 2014) when I was working full-time several years ago but have gone back to school since then (in 2016). I've been with BNS since the beginning and renewed my mortgage with them for 2.34% fixed for 5 yrs in Oct 2019. I checked around but I couldn't get approval from anywhere else as my income was very low. BNS was OK to let me stay with them so I just renewed there.

However, now that rates are really low, I was wondering about the possibility of switching to a lower rate. I suspect there will be some penalties associated with this but if it saves me more in the long run, it seems worth it to do. 

My question is, would they be able to do this without having to get approval based on my income? I know I should just check with them, but so far everyone I've talked to at BNS knows even less about mortgages than me and frankly I don't trust them much. So I wanted to ask online and then talk to them with some more info. Wasn't able to find any info online or on the wiki to match my specific situation either.

* Maximum Annual Other Expenses: 0.02%

Tenant Lease agreement ONTARIO- one month early termination,"I have a situation with my Landlord that is making me a little bit confused.
I rented a full house (3bedrooms)just before the Pandemic with a move in date of Apr 1st, 2020, as my landlord was leaving the country and left the basement for his family upon return. Due to the lockdown, he couldn’t leave the country and had no choice than to stay in the basement with his family.

Due to the inconvenience of living in a room basement with his spouse and 2kids, he had to go rent the basement next door. 
My lease ends on March 31st, 2021 but I had to start an early search for another place, since I know they need their house back which is understandable. 
On December 8, 2020 I got a place with a move in date of March 1st, 2021 and I informed my landlord right away of my intention to move out on March 1st, 2021 and he agreed. I even went further to explain to him that I got 2 options from the property manager; March 1st move in date for a 2bedroom and May 1st for a 3bedroom. I told him that I had to settle for a 2bedroom because I didn’t want to inconvenient his family as I understand the situation , hence, why I chose the less favourable option for my family .


One thing we never spoke about was the last month rent, so I reminded him on Jan 1st, that I will use my last month deposit in Feb 2021 as per our previous discussion.
Now, he is stating that I have to pay for Feb 2021 rent, and stay till March 31st, since that is the end date of the lease.
I have been trying to negotiate even a half month, so that I can leave on March 15th but he isn’t forthcoming. I hold him with high esteem, and the last thing I would want to do is to take this to Tenant board.

Questions about getting a mortgage with bad credit,"Hi everyone,

Sorry first time posting here so hope I’m doing it right.  

Long story short me and my partner are in a bad living situation with where we rent and are looking for a place to buy for our own. 


My credit is in the excellent range but my partners credit is in the poor range with a history of bankruptcy.  So pretty much I want to use her income but not her credit.  She is working on building her credit back up but we may need to leave before then.  

I heard something about having a joint bank account can count as me having her income. Any one have any knowledge of this or any other tips to get out of this situation.

Independent contractor or full time employee,"Long time lurker here. I currently needs to do a decision — whether I should keep myself as an independent contractor or a full time employee to a company.

Male, 34, working remotely for a us based company here in Canada, about $300k CAD (a dozen grands less than this number) annually. 

So now the company is going to have a C round, and manager asked me if I want to convert to full time because of the stock options.

I also have three employees under me to help me work on some other stealth startup projects, so this would effectively help me reduce my tax payment drastically.

Now I need to decide whether 1. to convert to an employee for the round B stock options, or 2. keep contractor status and ask for options as part of the compensation. 

What is the best thing I could do? Assuming the company could be potentially acquired at later round C/D or go public (it is a chip/asic company so it is unlikely).

Student new to Canada: Saving and checking at different banks? (Tangerine & CIBC),"Hi. I'm new to Canada. I'm a temporary resident (study permit) and I'm looking to set up a bank account. I've decided to start with a CIBC student checking account with its reward credit card. If I'm eligible I don't go for the student reward credit card because I have enough funding from the school to with CIBC regular reward credit card (according to the website it has a minimum income of 15k/y and more welcome bonus points).

I don't think I really need a saving account but the Tangerine money back credit card is very interesting and I hope I can get it after a year. The Tangerine website says if I deposit my rewards into the Tangerine saving account this card gives me 3 2% money back categories instead of 2 categories. That's why I want to open a savings account with them. 

So sad that Tangerine 5-month 2% interest promotion is for those who create both a saving and a checking account in Tangerine :(((( why not both saving and checking with Tangerine? well, CIBC credit card is very ideal for a newcomer like me. 1000 credit, auto rental insurance, good CIBC reward center promotions.

So I wanted to see if it is possible to have a saving account in one bank and a checking account in another bank? Isn't it bad for credit score? Basically the scenario I told is too ideal to be true imo (I still wish I get Tangerine promo by only making a saving account. That's even more than ideal lol). I may be overlooking sth.

business activity in tfsa? criteria is not clear,"If you are establishing some core positions (say up to 20-30 long term holdings) to hold long term (say over 1 year?)  but trade around them to establish them, or if perhaps there is a crash or bubble and you take some profits but always maintain some core amount is that ok in TFSA?

Also, some have suggested 50 trades/quarter to establish a position or adjust /trim it is ok, but where does this number come from? Can it be more, or less?

Also is arbitrage allowed? 

Also can part of your TFSA be long-term positions but a portion more swing oriented within the same year/month/week because a) you made a mistake and got out of a company for a better one b) the company just got too expensive fast through no fault of your own and want to protect yourself as a risk management tool so you sell some at crazy high price.

RRSP vs non-registered account when maxed out TFSA,"Hi there!

I have a question about account selection for my case. I know that It's a very specific question but was hoping that someone was in a similar situation or has the necessary background to help me.

I was fortunate enough to max out my TFSA. Now, I am trying to decide whether to start using RRSP or a non-registered investment account. I am 22, not a Canadian citizen or PR, in school, work, get support from family, and expect to save around $8,000-15,000 / year for the next 3 years while still living in Canada. 

The problem with RRSP is that I am not 100% sure whether I will ever retire in Canada so I don't want to have the risk of paying a withholding tax for early withdrawal. Another thing is that just this year I will probably be in the lowest income tax bracket but I could potentially use RRSP in the future, when my income is higher, to reduce it. So, I don't want to waste this opportunity.

The issue with a non-registered account is, of course, paying taxes today and having to keep a neat record of all my transactions to report to the government. The latter isn't a big issue but still.

So, what do you think I should choose? Do you know any other caveats that I may have missed? Or other options for me to get exposure to the stock market in Canada?

Thanks in advance for any information!",4,1610267161.0,2021,2021-01-10,Misc,sn0uflake,1,kuaqbh

I have maxed out my contribution limit for now, but am wondering if I can move that 30K in my TD mutual funds directly to a TFSA in Questrade, where I want to throw all that into an Index fund.

&#x200B;

Since I can't pay my Questrade account directly from my mutual fund account, (I'll go over my limit if I withdraw from my TD TFSA and then put it back into the Questrade TFSA)... can I simply transfer my TD TFSA to a questrade TFSA, and put it into a diff fund without violating any contribution limit?

Is there anything else to consider? 

&#x200B;

I am desperate! Thank you!",10,1610243296.0,2021,2021-01-09,,MCAT_Canada_COVID,1,ku4orn

How to handle tax situation for 3-5 weeks of overlap between internships?,"This summer I may (or may not) have 3-5 weeks of overlap between two consecutive internships as I transition from one internship to another (the hours won't overlap though as I will set my own hours for one of those internships and do it in the evenings/night). So this is what I had in mind:

When my new employer gives me their tax form to fill out I will check the box that says I have other sources of income. Consequently they will withhold extra tax to account for that but the overlap will only be for 3-5 weeks. I don't mind not getting the extra withheld tax until next tax season but I just wanted to make sure that I will get it next tax season at the end of the day. 

Or, should I let my new employer know that my tax situation will change 3-5 weeks in? I'd rather not have a conversation about why I have a second job but I'll do it if I have to as I don't believe I would be doing anything wrong, let alone breaking any rules.

I need help with organizing where to invest $150 k savings.,"I am 26 years old from ON and have housing provided by my employer. I've decided to take a housing allowance and find my own place to rent which will leave me at the end of the month with an extra $1500 in pocket after paying the rent and utilities. My salary is 86 to 95 k/ year net ( depends on OT I pick up) working as a healthcare professional on contracts in BC. My only monthly bills are my car insurance ($400/ month- high because I was in a car accident) and phone bill $65/ month, $85/ month health insurance. I have no debt, own my car, and don't own real estate.

TFSA in TD  $27,830
 RRSP TD  $18,500
Chequing in TD $13,000
HISA EQ with 1.5% interest- $92,700
HISA Simplii- $13000
Wealthsimple Trade- $1000 ( just started experimenting with trades) 

I feel like I am all over the place with savings and finding the best place to keep my money interest wise. 

I have always been a frugal person that cooks and doesn't eat out as much or need to buy much. I would eventually like to buy real estate but right now I don't even know where to start or where I would live. I would eventually like to buy a house with a future husband. With the contracts I am doing I have not been contributing to a pension and eventually I would go back to ON to pick up where I left off with 2 years working and contributing to HOOP. With these contracts out here in BC I am saving a hell of a lot more than I would be if I was working back in ON where I would be making $20 to 30 k less and also have to pay rent or mortgage if I decided to buy. I am happy here though exploring hiking snowboarding and living my best life until then. I have possible plans to return to ON July 2022.",18,1610241512.0,2021,2021-01-09,,seekitout,0,ku45hf

TFSA Portfolio Entering 2021,"Hey Reddit,

I'm(30m) looking for feedback and ideas for investing going into the new year, I tend to be on the higher risk side of investing, using trailing stops to lock in profits and cool off when things get nervous. I've attached my rough current portfolio breakdown.

I strongly believe in clean energy as almost every major nation is climbing on board for a larger push towards carbon reduction, I have a larger position in PBW because the hydrogen bubble forming but will likely move some of that to SMOG or ICLN when things cool off.

China's economy also looks as if it will continue to grow at a rapid rate but I don't have a very good idea how how to capitalize on it, I currently own CHNA.B and Mackenzie All China Equity mutual fund. If anybody has bullish ideas on other Chinese Equity I'd like to hear about it.

I believe that AI and robotics will continue to rapidly erode the value of labor and increase productivity standards which is why I have 30%+ of my portfolio is related industries. This one is a real Pandora's box and a quote I've heard is ""If a computer is a bicycle for the mind, AI tools are a fighter jet"".

Lastly my moonshot for 2021 is a broader deregulation of cannabis in the USA given the recent change in their political climate, I will likely move out of my beloved Shopify and put more into Cannabis.

Got a TD direct investing account but unsure if I want to use it or transfer to HISA,"Signed up for a TD direct investing account a few months back intending to put money into a TFSA with ETFs. I transferred my current savings 20k into the TDDI account and it currently resides in a high interest TFSA. I opened up a direct investing TFSA but haven’t made the move to purchasing ETFs yet. My predicament is that I’m not so sure I want to invest in ETFs anymore.

I’m 28 and will be looking to buy property in the next five years (most likely with a spouse). Looking into it, if I intend to use my savings for the down payment I should instead put that money into a HISA instead of ETFs since 5 years out is too short of a time frame with the risk.

The 20k is sitting in an HISA but only at a rate of 0.05%. EQ bank is currently at the highest rate of 1.5%. So I was thinking of transferring that money over to EQ bank but would incur a closing fee of $150.

Should I transfer the entire 20k over? I also have an additional 20k I’ve saved up in a chequing account (which started as my emergency fund but has grown more and more) which I will be looking to do something with most likely to EQ bank in the HISA.

Alternatively I could transfer out 5k to EQ along with the additional 20k in my chequing and keep 15k in the TDDI TFSA and buy ETFs to start saving for retirement (having 15k in the TDDI prevents the quarterly $25 account fee). But should I maximize the money I have to put it all towards a down payment or have some invested for retirement?",3,1610235588.0,2021,2021-01-09,,godofsmores,0,ku2c4r

Purchasing a Mobile Home (NS),"I (21M) got a sizeable chunk of change set aside to purchase a house when I graduate (May 2022)/ after 2 years of working (constantly contributing to this, close to $30k excluding savings for school+investing). I am considering postponing a purchase on a detached single family home ($300k-$350k), and purchasing a mobile home ($100k) with my gf (21) and renting the other room out to family (her sister and bf). They would be living there for a 1 year guarantee (potentially longer) and obviously helping pay the monthly expenses. It would be 2 couples, so 4 people contributing to the monthly expenses. Does this seem reasonable or should I be waiting for a better deal on a detached home after I graduate? I can afford the monthly expenses myself after graduating and assuming I find work in my profession (chemical engineering). I am inexperience when it comes to mobile home rates and timeframes, so please enlighten me if this is a dumb idea.

26yo trying to figure out what to do with three years of savings. I'd love some help.,"Hey!! I'm Noel. 

I'm a marketing grad from Toronto, and could really use some advice from you guys.

I graduated in 2018 debt free, thanks to some amazing parents who paid off my $30,000 degree. I got hired doing customer service for a tech company that paid $40k + $5k in equity. 

Nine months ago I joined their marketing team, was given a $60k salary, and my $5k company equity grew to $30k. Living at home with few major expenses allowed me to save 50% of my annual income. 

Despite doing okay financially, I've been feeling a little lost, and can't really talk about this to anyone I know. I want to move out as soon as it's safe to do so again, and I've got a couple questions for you guys. I've listed my numbers out below:

Account | $
---|---
ETF Portfolio: | $75,000
Company Stock: | $25,000
Personal Stocks: | $15,000
Cash: | $5,000
Retirement: | $4,000
Bitcoin: | $3,000
*Total:* | $127,000 CAD


1) I'm debating buying a condo to live in ($2000/mo) or renting a place with a friend for a year ($1200/mo). The Toronto market starts at $500k, and I'd need to put down all my savings + borrow a little from my parents to carry the mortgage on my 60k salary. What would you do?


2) Coming from customer support, I'm being underpaid at my job, and my increase isn't until May. I could get paid $80k elsewhere, but my job is meaningful, and I adore it. Would you wait it out, or look for something else at a different company?


3) Until I figure out what to do with this money, do you think it's best kept in my diversified stock portfolio + etf? I'm averaging 30% + 12% returns returns respectively, but it feels weird saving up for something, when I'm not sure what that something is.",5,1610233885.0,2021,2021-01-09,Investing,throwaway373706,3,ku1tr4

Why do carriers keep getting away with this?,"(I think it’s ok to post this here due to it being about a price increase)

Bell is set to increase wireless prices again, and most likely Telus and Rogers will follow suit. 

If you’re on a BYOD plan, you’re at the mercy of the company. That’s sort of ok for BYOD. 

However, if you’re on contract I don’t understand why any things you’d like to change you’d need to pay a penalty for, however if the carrier wants to increase your rate plan price, they’re free to do so even if you’re in the middle of a contract. Not much of a contract if you ask me... 👀

What happens when a mortgage segment comes up for renewal?,"Hi there:

I am with RBC for my mortgage. In the past 5 years I have bought three homes, sold two. As a result each time I bought something more expensive and ported my existing mortgage over.

Each of the three mortgage segments form my one mortgage. I have three separate payments bi-weekly... and my HELOC is part of it too.

One of the segments are coming up for renewal this November.

My first question is, if the bank refuses to renew this segment - does that mean the other two segments get cancelled too? They don't renew for another 3 and 4 years respectively.

The reason I am worried they may refuse to renew is the fact I have used more of my available credit on post graduate studies - which I think might concern them - along with some installment loans from The Brick. It's enough money that while I am capable of paying it down - I know they are sticklers when it comes to approvals at RBC (after going through mortgage applications before).

My second question: Are mortgage renewals very in-depth or is it just a rubber stamping type of thing if you stick with the same lender?

Put 100k in RRSP

Pick a prescribed rate to pay interest to yourself. You can pick high or low rate?

Invest the 100k in tfsa or taxable.

If you invest in taxable account  is the interest you pay to yourself tax deductible?

You get the deduction and pay (to yourself) a “penalty” of Interest to access that money immediately.

Am I missing something. It would seem like if one could deducted interest than saving RRSP first is the best. Even if not the cost of leveraging is just saving more money.

Also you can day trade in RRSP not in tfsa.

"Aside from loss of contribution room for the year, are there any disadvantages to transferring money out of a TFSA to another using e-transfer?","Hi there,

I would like to transfer money from a TFSA to another using e-transfer. 

To be clear, I would follow these steps: 

1. Internal transfer from TFSA at institution A to chequing account at institution A 
2. E-transfer from chequing account at institution A to chequing account at institution B 
3. Internal transfer from chequing account at institution B to TFSA at institution B. 

The reason for which I want to do this, as opposed to a TFSA transfer performed by the banking institution, is to avoid a service fee imposed by the latter. If I follow the steps outlined above, would I experience any drawbacks aside from the loss of contribution room (which I explain below) for the remainder of 2021?

If I understand well, say my contribution room for 2021 is 10K and I transfer 1K using the procedure above, I would ""lose"" this 1K contribution room (as if this was a new 1K I was adding to my TFSAs) for the remainder of 2021 but would regain it on the 1st of January 2022 along with the amount the government will be adding for the year of 2022? 

My question might sound a little basic but I just want to make sure I don't do anything silly and face unexpected consequences. Thank you so much for the help, I really appreciate it.",17,1610226089.0,2021,2021-01-09,Banking,BigBadBreadLoaf,1,ktzcd6

Who and what is covered,"Hi PFC,

I am wondering when it comes to property insurance. Will a policy cover immediate family (mother and brother over 18)  living in the same household.

I understand if you have a basement apartment or something with a tenant you need to have more coverage or perhaps a different policy. But what about the above scenario.

Covid 19 has hit some people pretty hard financially. Not only could I use the extra help but so could they. We were talking about it over the holidays. They wouldn't be renting per-say more so just sharing the house and chipping in for things like electricity, gas, internet cable etc. 

So when it comes to immediately family living in the household. Are their implications to that insurance wise? Does a separate policy need to be purchased?

Market vs Investment Properties,"Hello;

Live in the building for a year, move out and buy a second investment property with the equity build from the first property (rinse and repeat x3)

If I take this route, I will be significantly reducing my investments compound interest because Ill go from like 160,000 to 0 with the down payment. 

I would be investing from this position with my salary earnings at my work (which will be large because I wont be paying rent)

My passive income business isnt being built to make me rich, just to gain an additional flow of income. 

Any advice is appreciated. 

Also, If I go this route, would I be better off buying more investment properties with my salary, or investing it into the market?",10,1610223997.0,2021,2021-01-09,Investing,TORMapleJays,0,ktyoab

HELOC or bridge loan for downpayment?,"I currently have a condo that I’m planning to sell to purchase a home with my partner. We’ve gotten a joint- mortgage pre approval with a new lender, vs my current one (as rates a lower with the new lender), but the new lender did not want to provide me with a bridge loan should the closing dates of my sale / purchase differ (as I’m not an existing mortgage customer). 

Question is - would the bank I’m currently holding the mortgage with provide me with a bridge loan if I’m planning to close out my mortgage with them? If not, would a HELOC on my existing home work to have sufficient funds to pay for the downpayment on the new home, while I wait to sell my first home?

Mortgage Refinancing Fees,"Hi all,

We’re thinking about refinancing our home in order to finish our big renos that we don’t want to pay out of pocket (additional bathroom, garage, etc) while mortgage rates are low.

Investing as a Canadian permanent resident from US,"As an American living in Canada as a permanent resident, I have learned through PFC that investing in a TFSA is not recommended. So my other option is to invest in an RRSP. Currently, my RRSP contribution room is fairly low, as I have only been working in Canada since January 2018. Would it be wise to invest the maximum amount possible each year in my RRSP, or am I missing something significant, perhaps about the TFSA or another retirement savings option in Canada?

Just FYI, I have a RPP through my employer, and have maxed out the matching program contributions, as well as a GSOP. However, these two accounts do not really amount to a great deal of money.

My spouse is Canadian and contributes a significant amount of each paycheck (roughly 40%) to his RRSP and TFSA.

Courbes de Laferrère (Laferrère's curves),"Fellow Quebecers, I just wanted to share my favorite goldmine of information when planning RRSP contributions for the year (or beneficial adjustments until the end of february) : Les courbes de Laferrière : [https://www.cqff.com/claude\_laferriere/accueil\_courbe.htm](https://www.cqff.com/claude_laferriere/accueil_courbe.htm)

Those curves are showing two marginal rates : The income tax marginal rates (Quebec / Canada) in blue, and the adjusted « real » marginal rate with the different government programs in pink. This is eye opening in some cases, where we can see in example that a household income of 45 000$ with one kid is paying more than 70% of marginal tax rate at this level of income : [https://www.cqff.com/claude\_laferriere/courbes2020/2020-courbe-241.pdf](https://www.cqff.com/claude_laferriere/courbes2020/2020-courbe-241.pdf)

Job Offer - Financial Implications as a Canadian Working for a US Company,"Recently, I was given two job offers - one in Toronto (where I currently reside) and one in California (where I am not a resident and would require a visa). Both are health research positions for a one year contract with the possibility of extension. Given the pandemic, the position in California is WFH (and you don’t need a visa when working remotely). They would, however, like to get me a visa when WFH orders are lifted. But, that’s jumping the gun a bit. 

I’m curious about some of the financial implications of working for an American company as a Canadian. I was given an offer as an employee of the company on a fixed contract. Do you pay income taxes for both countries? How do benefits work when you’re on an American payroll? Any other financial aspects that are important for me to note? Specifically thinking about financial aspects for remote work.

I’m also wondering about people’s experiences with the visa process (either amidst COVID or not). The company would have me complete the visa paperwork, however they would provide any necessary documentation to support the visa process.

GIC rates are bad - what should I do with my RRSP?,"I have about $10k in GICs in an RRSP account at a big-5 that are coming up to maturity, and I'm trying to decide what to do with the money.

The options are to just leave the GIC to renew at a garbage rate (it was a bit better 5 years ago when I opened it, like 1.6% compared to 0.2% now), to keep it at the big-5 but change it to something more aggressive, or to move it to Tangerine where I could do a GIC or possibly change it to an ETF there.

Opinions on first time home buyers plan.,"Happy Saturday everyone. Just looking to start a bit of a conversation based on my own personal situation. Love this sub I've been creeping it for quite awhile lol.

About me. I live in the Edmonton area. I'm currently in the market to buy a home in the \~400k territory. I've been approved for 420 with a %5 down payment @ .99% interest. I have the savings to put up a 20% down payment but I don't believe it would be a good idea from a financial standpoint. I'm starting to actually consider putting 0 down and letting the government make the down payment through the HBI. My rationale, such as it is, is that I would be very likely to do better than 1% gains on my investment portfolio. Given the state of RE in Alberta I also don't really envision prices rising to any amazing degree in the next 10ish years so who cares if the government has 5% equity?

NR73 form and investment in Canada,"I have read old posts but I think my wife situation is kind of different. So I will post hers.


My wife is a Canadian Citizen and left Vancouver back in 2009. She didn’t fill out NR73 form. She didn’t file tax return after leaving Canada. She did pay taxes in the current country - Hong Kong.

She has no ties in Canada - no bank accounts, no assets/properties, no dependants, no driver license.


Right now we have an idea to purchase a property in Vancouver (with mortgage) and we are renting it out if we can purchase one. So here are my questions:


1) Is it necessary to have her to fill back the NR73 form?
  

2) She will purchase the property as a foreign investor so we know there’s withholding tax for this. But not sure if CRA will chase back that she had not file any tax returns?


3) She will open a HSBC Canada account from HK (as a foreign investor) and we are not sure if we need to inform CRA on this? (but if the property is successfully rented out then we are going to pay withholding tax anyway, not sure if we still need to inform them).


For info, she didn’t think she would go back to Canada anything soon at the time of the leaving. But now fast forward to 2021, eventually, we would like to move back to Canada in the near future (say 3-5 years) along with our kid and will take back the property for own use.

Should I go all in on VGRO?,"I am 33 years old and realize that it's time to get serious with planning for my future and retirement. I have been chucking 50$ a pay check and some Christmas money into an RRSP starting when I was 18 and it's sitting around 20k. I did that with a mutual fund that my folks set up for me.
 
Getting serious now I have been reading up on how to do self-directed investing and I have set up a Questrade account. On the 15th of this month I plan on starting with the minimum 1000$ deposit then going with 200$ per pay check until I retire. 

My original plan was to go 50% EFT (Vanguard or Ishare), 25% Individual Stocks, 25% Bitcoin. I am running into the a mental road block that keeps telling me we are in a bubble and bitcoin and any stocks I buy into (TSLA, Apple or facebook) is going to plummet. 

At this point I feel like i'm over thinking investing and maybe I should just go all in and put 100% into VGRO until the market correction (bubble bursting) then try my luck with individual stocks and or bitcoin.

The other option is that I just invest in bitcoin, stocks AND VGRO and ride the ups and downs, since i'v got 30ish some odd years before I actually need to use any of this money.

(side note) I'm just going to leave the 20k in RRSP alone for now.",108,1610206127.0,2021,2021-01-09,Investing,evilpigclone,34,ktsu9n

I have finally saved some money to invest - Contribute to RRSP or TFSA first?,"Quick backstory.

Paid off my debts, started saving for the first time. 

RRSP Deduction room  - $111k

Saved $26k this year.

Looking to learn about investing, and managing this money better. I already have some basic RRSP/TFSA accounts open on wealthsimple with minor contributions.

Just looking for some general guidance.... but my current plan would be to:

Drop this money into my RRSP, hoping to get some good return on my Taxes... and then putting that into my TFSA.

With those, I plan on letting the Wealthsimple roboadvisors do it's work.

Is there something I should be doing differently? Does a lump-sum into RRSP make sense?

First time home buying with decent savings but serious student loan debt.,"Happy New Year! Currently looking to buy a house in New Brunswick, as a resident here.

I only make 50,000 a year. 
I have a 58,000 student loan debt. 
I do have a downpayment of 20,000 (plus a cushion of 10,000)
A biweekly car payment of 168 (ends in '24)
No credit card debt.
Strong credit (unsure of exact score)
Would be first time home buyer

I manage my loan payments through the repayment assistance program, minimising my payments and it keeps the interest from accruing on the loan (very thankful for this)

I'm finishing a master's degree in June, hoping to land a job more in the 65-70,000 range by '22.

I currently pay 1040 in rent, it's going up to 1070 in Feb. 

Considering asking a parent to co-sign a loan, they would not be making much more than I per year.

a home at 200,000 is what I'm hoping for.

Is it rediculous to consider buying a home, even with a cosigner,  with so much student loan debt?  is it even possible? Should I be waiting for some magic savings/debt number?

I have a kiddo who loves playing outside and living in an apartment building is getting old.

Any Banks That Waive Account Fee with Balance Stored in TFSA?,"Are there any banks that waive the monthly / quarterly account fee from money in a TFSA and not just sitting in the chequing account?

Question on Tax Return,"Hello Everyone,

I am helping a friend to amend her 2017 tax return and need some help.

My friend moved to Canada back in 2017 (in August) from South Korea with a working visa.  She filed her tax return recently and CRA determined that she was a resident of Canada for only part of 2017. As a result, CRA calculated her federal non-refundable tax credits by prorating them based on the # of days she was a resident of Canada.

Yesterday, she received a communication from CRA saying she should confirm her world income in order for them to correctly calculate her gst/hst.  our understanding is that as she was a resident of Canada for part of 2017, she was supposed to report any income earned outside of Canada. Does this mean she should amend her tax return to include this information? Also, what are the tax implications for amending the return to include her foreign income? 

When we researched online we noted that if she paid tax back in Korea, she can get foreign tax credits, which will reduce her tax payable. However, if she got her tax back in Korea as her income was not significant and she was not required to pay tax, how does it impact her tax return in Canada? Does it mean she will get taxed on Canadian tax rate on the income she earned back in Korea?

Any advice on this would be much appreciated!  Thanks.",4,1610171459.0,2021,2021-01-09,,PianistValuable6660,0,ktl451
Should I buy my leased car?,"The lease for my '17 Prius is ending soon and I'm contemplating just buying it but I would need to finance it (about 15k). I wasn't planning on buying the car after the lease but now I have 2 reasons why I'm thinking about it. First, I leased it to drive up to 96,000km but I only ended up putting about 45k on the car as of right now and my lease is up in March. Looking on auto trader, a 2017 prius with less than 50k kilometers is going for average 20k to 22k. Second, my business has been closed since March due to covid and have had to put more than I usually ever would on my credit card so my score has gone down a lot (usually at 780ish now I'm sitting around 700) so I don't really want to go through the whole financing department thing again with a new (or used) car. I realize I might still need to do that to finance the 15k buyout amount but my husband has a LOC available if I need to just put it on that.

"New Year, New goals?","Are there any cons to paying off car loan before student loan?

I recently started looking in to Dave Ramsey; and was hoping to get my finances in order.

In terms of finances, I bought a new car last year and still am carrying quite a bit of osap debt. As of now the amount owed on the car is 24k(interest is 2.99) and for student loans is 26k(interest prime+1?). 

I am leaning towards paying the car off first since it is a lower amount but people around me have suggest paying off osap. Are there any pros and cons to either?

One of the main reasons for me paying off my car loan is that the industry I work for is very boom or bust...in case things go south I would be able to defer osap payments but not car payments.

Is going to Cegep worth it? I am lost 16M,"I am in Quebec, lived here my entire life. This is my final year of grade 11, meaning after this year I would graduate with a diploma and an IB certificate for my program I was in (if possible), which was the MYP for the IB program here at my school for the duration of my time whilst here from grade 7 to grade 11. My 2nd term mark from last year had an average of about 87% and this term, I have not gotten my report card, however I did pass everything (maybe not physics though).

After searching, I have discovered Quebec offers bursaries and such, I did not check there yet though. For me I do have some limiting factors such as: single parent, multiple siblings (4), relatively low income household (not extremely). As for my health I have had a rare form of brain cancer in my back for the previous 6 years and it hasn't gone away regardless of treatments I have gone through (going for a followup next week for an MRI scan to see if it spread more than my last radiotherapy, if so by how much). My back is relatively injured due to the constant hammering of radiation as well as surgery done to remove a part of the spinal cord to get to the tumour, however my back had arced before due to the first initial tumour, and recovery is slow but it does normal now, however lifting heavy things is not advised by doctors. I do not know if these variables influence the end result of helping improve my financial status. Also, preferably I do not want to work as I much rather be studying full time.

Now, I am on edge with what I need to do next to attain some level of stability and learning to go with this. For what I would like to do in Cegep, it will be computer science in Dawson with the technical degree program. However I would be ok with other Cegeps as well. As for expenses and costs throughout the years studying here, I only have a total of 4000$ to work with from my own money, so I plan on taking a student loan at somewhat low interests rates if possible which I am fine with, as I already did the math and it'll cost me about 15-18 thousand dollars at max. However, if something comes up and my father kicks me out of the house, I already planned a budget for this instance and it'll cost me a bit less than 35k for everything in a student loan. I am wondering if there are better options out here, preferably other computer/IT sectors I am missing out here.

I love technology and aspects to do with managing and working with them, which is why I would like to try computer science, however I do not know what debt is like. If I do go through with this model, by the end I would have a technical degree in computer science which could lead to an opportunity as:

&#x200B;

* software developer
* web developer (front and back end)
* mobile software developer
* quality assurance tester
* other computer science related careers[dawson program here](https://www.dawsoncollege.qc.ca/computer-science-technology/)

Now, these do interests me as I cannot fully go into computer engineering as it apparently relies heavily on physics and I absolutely don't have the marks in physics for that. What I am thinking of for my end goal would be somewhere in either the back end for maintenance of servers and such, or somewhere I can repair and monitor the integrity of a server as well a the hardware involved. That is basically database maintenance and requires other things to learn as well, which I plan on learning online after I land myself as a software developer or something similar. This end goal is basically a database administrator or computer system's analyst. Either one of them is of course more years down the line, however after Cegep I would be making around 50k or less base salary (according to results on some job ads here).

Does this all sound sustainable, if not what can I change about this plan? Also if any other people involved in this specific education program or graduates could help me, that would be greatly appreciated.

Worth while to end wife's visa and add her on my points card?,"Hey guys, I manage our finances between my wife and I. for credit building Since we were young she's had a visa in her name she uses, limit is 500, we Pay it out monthly, I have a points card and I'm tempted to add her onto mine and end hers so we can gain more points for travel but that means it won't help her credit rating (not that it needs any help) I'm thinking at this point in our lives Im far from worried about credit and credit score building anyways and we got a mortgage in our names and credit score is far from an issue. I'm probably over thinking this lol. 

Should I keep her with her own visa or do what I'm thinking?

Edit: forgot to add her card has an annual fee of $120, it's a. Cash back and she only got $70 back last year, so I figure if I keep her card active to not use it'll be swapped out to a no charge visa anyways.",9,1610163929.0,2021,2021-01-08,Credit,Octan3,0,ktj6be

Non Registered Gains into Un-maxed RRSP.,"Hey there,

I've been thinking about this and want to bounce my understanding of it off you guys.  

Basically, in the immediate future (January) I was hoping to open an non registered account to invest in. I've currently maxed out my TFSA and have about 60, 000 in contribution room for my RRSP.  This coming year Im anticipating a significant increase in income due to a big salary jump, so I want to save that contribution room for the year(s) ahead. So my uncertainty stands around the general advice that one max out their tfsa and rrsp before venturing into a non registered account...  I didn't generate that much income in 2020 so I figure I won't deduct income through my RRSP this year... rather, I'm thinking what if I put it into a non registered account and perhaps make some gains... is it possible to offset the tax on those gains by transfering that all into my rrsp the following year when I'll wish to deduct my income, since I anticipate it to be much more this coming year? 

Essentially, I'm hoping to better understand the relationship between transferring capital gains from a non registered account into an RRSP, mathematically.  As well, is it common to hold off contributing to an RRSP in anticipation of a higher salary in coming years, and opt for investing through a non registered account?

Thanks for your time,",8,1610161157.0,2021,2021-01-08,Taxes,Dblazer,0,ktiezv

Is there any cost savings buying a used house versus building new?,"I'm just starting to look into purchasing a home and I've been browsing several listings on some real estate websites. I'm pretty new to this process, and I guess i wanted some input from people who might be more familiar with the housing market.

I've been looking at neighborhoods that are being developed and I imagined buying a used home in some of these areas would bring some substantial cost savings. However, I've noticed that some of these homes (Maybe around 10 years old) are priced very similarly to new ones being sold by the builder.

I imagine with a used home, you'd have to factor in the costs associated with things being more worn... Being closer to needing to replace the water tank, replacing the roofing, and other expenses like that (I'm not entirely sure what are all the costs, so let me know if there are other things that I should be considering). If I consider these costs, is there still a net cost savings on a used home?

Outside of the advantages of having a better choice of the location, is there any cost benefit of buying a used home? Am I better off just buying one off of a builder?

Would really appreciate any feedback that people have or advice that people can offer for a first time home buyer. Thanks.",27,1610156499.0,2021,2021-01-08,,gcxedm,0,kth3di

Buying US Stock at 19 (Questrade)?,"I'm 19 and have very little knowledge about stocks or finances in general. However, a company that I'm familiar with is soon going to go public through a ""direct listing"" and I'm trying to figure out the best way to invest some of my savings into it.

From the googling I've done, it seems a lot people are adamant about using Questrade to buy US stocks from Canada. I brought up Questrade to my mom and she seemed really skeptical, telling me I should just make an appointment at the bank and let them figure it out for me. I'd rather go the online DIY route if I can, even though I know I'm more prone to making mistakes.

The source of a lot of my confusion right now is between TFSAs and RRSPs, both of which are completely unused for me. I have $18k contribution room in the TFSA but only $4000 room in the RRSP. People online are saying to invest American stocks into the RRSP in order to avoid the 15% withholding tax that's a part of the TFSA and other accounts.

So here are my questions:

1. Should I consult with someone at the bank first or is it fine to venture solo via Questrade?
2. Do you recommend putting US stocks into your RRSP? What happens when I want to sell stocks out of my RRSP? Are there any future headaches involving the RRSP that I should be worried about if I go this route?
3. Is it possible to invest more than $4000 or do I just have to wait for the limit to increase?
4. I'm not sure if the stock will pay dividends, should this influence my decisions in any way? (and how do I find out if it pays dividends if the stock doesn't exist yet)

We live pretty simply and happily but wonder what would happen if she got pregnant and we had to live off a single income ... in BC

**Education:** I have a UBC science degree from the days I hoped to become a doctor, decided medicine wasn't for me. Finished the degree but really struggled to enjoy the lab based biotech jobs the degree opens up for me.

Canadian Citizen Reporting US Income (Referral Bonus),"I'll try to keep it short;

&#x200B;

I (a Canadian citizen who was in university) interned at a company in California in 2018 on a J-1 student visa; I manually filed my tax return to the IRS/CTB and CRA the following tax season following some old Waterloo student's guide; no hiccups there.

Others?) do I fill out as a \*Canadian citizen\* who did not work in the US in 2020, but received a post-taxed referral bonus from the company I worked at in 2018, do I submit?

Has anyone gone with HSBC 0.99% 5 yr variable? We are conditionally approved and have questions.,"Evening Redditors and thanks in advance for your help.  My husband and I have been conditionally approved for the 0.99% 5 yr variable mortgage through HSBC.  We close on the house Feb 1st.  We have also been approved for a 1.69% fixed mortgage through TD Bank (this house has had a long close) but decided to apply last minute for the HSBC mortgage when we read about it.

Our agent at HSBC is nice but not the most informative.  I sent him an email with a list of questions and when it came to me asking about the penalty for breaking it, he has been unable to give me details.  He has also assured us we can switch after two years to a fixed mortgage but I'm wondering if we would be forced to take whatever rate HSBC wanted to offer us? 

I love the idea of saving the money for the next year or two with the 0.99% variable rate and originally I thought that if we decided to flip the house after a year or two (we got a good price through a private sale) that it would be cheaper to break the mortgage with a variable rate.  But now I'm second guessing myself, mainly because of the lack of answers from the HSBC agent.  The mortgage broker who got us the TD mortgage was super informative and gave us straight answers.  

So I was wondering if anyone else had gone with the HSBC rate, and if so maybe you had a better agent and knew more of the details!  Thanks so much.",56,1610153145.0,2021,2021-01-08,,Dovebvi,50,ktg44t

"Canada Computers sold me a Used/OpenBox GPU as new, refused to refund me. Took it up with TD Credit Cards dispute dpt and they're being quite difficult and bizarre.","So on November 30th I purchased a **new** Gigabyte RTX 3090 from Canada Computer's online website. Usually I use CC as a last resort (as you're all aware of the horror stories) but since stock has been abysmal for these GPUs I had to keep my options open. The GPU arrived on the 4th of Dec and when I opened the shipping box, I noticed that the packaging had already been tampered with. The seals on the flaps were cut, the box was ripped up, and the anti-static discharge bag was badly wrinkled and was already open. The seal that's on these bags had a clear cut on it. Along with that the GPU had no plastic (remove) stickers and the dust made it even more apparent it was clearly used. Along with that when I had installed it in my system that fans were making a pretty bad rattling noise. So this unit was clearly returned but instead of RMAing it back to the manufacturer they either intentionally sold it as new or it could have been a mistake. Regardless I ordered what was supposed to be brand new product and didn't get the item as described. Nor did the order or website mention anything of it being a used/open box item.  
  
Seeing as how it was a Friday and their HO is closed on the weekends, I called them Monday, Dec 7 and explained the situation to their customer service rep. At first they were a bit dismissive and in denial stating how this couldn't had happened which annoyed me but then told me to go to my nearest store and they would be able to help me with a refund. I then went to the store and spoke the associate who handled returns and immediately was told they cannot return the item because products like this GPU are final sale. If had I purchased this item and I changed my mind sure maybe that's on me. However this item wasn't even brand new in the first place, I did NOT get what I had ordered and I shouldn't be responsible for their fuckup plus its defective. After some back and forth, the associate said they'd get their manager to get back to me as they can't authorize the return. A couple days later the manager calls, starts pedaling the same BS, accuses me of opening the GPU and says they can't return it. I called their head office who told me they would need to ""investigate"" this incident and would get back to me for a refund. Well a few follow up emails and month afterwards I have received nothing.  
  
I decided to call TD credit cards dispute department and told them the situation. What I thought would be a simple process turned out to be quite bizarre and trivial. I had told the rep everything that had happened and my attempts to work on a resolution with the merchant. They took down all the details and then told me that because its an expensive transaction they would need a letter from a third party. When I asked them to elaborate they basically said to go another retailer such as Staples or a bestbuy and ask them to confirm the item was open box or used. What the actual fuck? The issue I had is with Canada Computers, this has nothing do with any other retailer. TD was basically saying go to another retail store, and get their manager to write a letter to support me. What a trivial fucking process, I basically told them that's ridiculous, and a letter from should be sufficient enough. Plus how bizarre would it be for me to go to another retail store and get them to explain another retailer sold me a used item and to write me a letter. First of all they'll probably not want to get involved since this transaction has nothing to do with them and second of all, because of covid this going to be extremely difficult to do. I was dumbfounded by this, like I explained everything that has happened and it should be a straight forward process. Contact the merchant and if they aren't willing to rightfully sort it out then just do the charge back.  
  
Anyways, I wrote a letter myself and faxed it to them but basically the TD rep says the merchant can basically deny everything and they can lose the case and I'll be out almost $2300. And they won't process anything until they get this faxed letter and approve of it. I'm honestly considering closing this credit card and going with a more consumer friendly company.",162,1610152448.0,2021,2021-01-08,Misc,Husmd1711,287,ktfwpj

High(Incorrect) Visa Balance,"I hope this is the right place to post this. I went to pay off part of my visa balance last night which was sitting around $4500. I have a limit of $5000(inb4 only use 30% I know). when I submitted the pay request for $2000 I received a date related error message which I remedied by pushing the payment date to today. It went through this morning and when I finally looked to see that everything matched up, the $2000 had been withdrawn from my chequing account and my visa balance was only down to $3600. Upon further inspection I looked at Dec. 20(a random pick) on my current bill to see if it matched up with Dec. 20 on my previous months bill as there is several day overlap. On my current bill it shows Dec. 20 at $6997, on the previous month it shows it as $4000.

Has anyone experienced something like this? There have been no charges pending larger than a couple hundred dollars at most. My banker is looking into it with visa but thought I’d ask here as well.

Spoke with my banker and she partly explained that another payment from earlier in the month hadn’t gone through for some reason, but failed to explain the $3000 discrepancy between the two bills on the same date.

Advice for my situation ? (19M),"Hey.

I’ll keep it brief and quick.

I am 19, turning 20 in a few months.

I have been extremely frugal my full life + lived with parents thus every dollar I’ve earned has really gone into a savings account.

Additionally, i was lucky enough to start a business which was thriving around quarter 3/4 of 2020.

I’m in university but as fortunate to achieve scholarships & have no forms of debt. I don’t own a car.

I currently have about $150k. Yes I know this is a large amount of money for someone my age. None of this is inheritance or given money. This is all earned by me.

I’ll have about 15k in income tax to pay for 2020.

Currently I am:
120k in a HISA
15k in low risk ETFs
& about 15k in liquid assets for my business (sellable product)

I am not one to go all in on an independent or risky stock however I want to know what is the best and consistent way to grow this money.

Is there any suggestions? Yet again, I am not a risk taker. I’d rather my basic 5-8% growth per year, but also do not want to be earning just 1.5% in my savings account. I should be able to very well set-up in about 20 years if based on the basic idea of compound interest and/or dividend drip investing.

Cheers in advance.",5,1610146126.0,2021,2021-01-08,,Cxnxdian,0,ktdv9e

Rent vs Selling,"Alberta: Here we go again with the same dilemma in renting and buying in my case selling.

As a first time home owner I’m thinking to sell my duplex with double garage (Alberta). Got it in 2017 specs home directly from the builder. I love my house! I don’t have a fence yet but I did put some grass 2 summers ago.

Anyway I’m thinking to rent a smaller space could be 2 bedroom All-In apartment condo for about $1250 with underground or parking spot outside. Don’t  care so much about parking as a drive an older car as long as I have assigned spot I’m good. 

My current mortgage is $1400+tax+insurance+utilities. I can afford it but my problem is I didn’t realized the work I need to put into it. Mowing lawn, snow removal and hated it. I’ve watered the grass too much to keep it looking green every time. I’m not very handy on gardening or carpentry or whatever. I also don’t need this much space 3 bedrooms, living room and a unfinished basement. If there’s tiny house I could buy in Alberta that could work a lot better for me. 

My concern is a lot of people told me house is good investment yada yada , economy will go back up so that got me worried that I’m making a bad decision selling it. I know I’ll lose some money if I do. I’m also in variable rate and only have to pay 3 months penalty I think around $1000.

What is the current and up to date process of opening a TD eSeries account?,"Hi,

I'm almost done reading ""Millionaire Teacher"" as was recommended by this subreddit. And I have currently booked an appointment to open a TD Mutual Fund TFSA account at my local TD branch as I already hold my chequing accounts with TD. I am hoping to then convert it to a TD eSeries fund and follow one of the CCP model portfolios. My only concern is, I am a bit confused about whether or not this process is still valid. 

I've read in some posts that I can only purchase TD eSeries on a TD Direct Investing account and that conversion of a TD Mutual Fund into a TD eSeries is no longer possible. 

The other question I have is, what are the differences if both processes are still valid, in terms of ""fees""? TD has been incredibly vague in explaining the process of conversion and navigating their website has been such a pain.

 I'd very much appreciate the clarification on this.

"Are CEBA forgiven funds forgiven the moment 75% is paid back, or Dec 31 2022?","A small detail but potentially quite important when it comes to restrictions. 

""Your loan is interest free before December 31, 2022, and principal payments are not required. If the loan isn’t repaid by January 1, 2023, the loan becomes a 3-year term with a 5% fixed interest rate per year. If you received a $40,000 CEBA loan, you can repay 75 percent of the total amount ($30,000) by December 31, 2022 and the remaining 25 percent ($10,000) is eligible for a loan forgiveness benefit.""

In addition, there are restrictions on what you can use the CEBA funds for. For example, you can't refinance existing indebtedness, make capital purchases, etc. 

The forgiven amount of $10,000 was already taxed in 2020. The questions is how long the restrictions on how you can use that money lasts.

If a corporation paid $30,000 of their $40,000 on Jan 1, 2021, would the $10,000 remaining in their account now be theirs to use in the business as they see fit? Or would they have the same CEBA funds usage restrictions all the way till Dec 31 2022?

Questwealth Vs Wealthsimple Rates of Return,"Hey PFC!

I've had a pretty good run with my questwealth portfolio. I basically opted for the highest risk/reward option they could provide as it was supposed to be a long term investment. Start of Nov 2019 to end of December 2019 gained almost 6%, then up to about 15% before the March covid crash took it down to -18%. It's back up to 14% as of writing this.

Before I went with a robo-advisor I was planning on opening a self directed trading account, but with the initial returns I figured I'd never be able to attain that on my own.

I've now closed my account as I needed the capital for a large purchase I put on my LOC.  Most people are of the opinion that a market correction is on the way  so I bailed while I was ahead,  as paying off my debt was a guaranteed way to ""make"" the interest on my LOC safely.

In a few months I plan on re-opening a tfsa. I've been reading that the rates of return with Wealthsimple have had returns as much as 6 times what questwealth portfolios have made. 

How have your guys ROR been with questwealth and Wealthsimple? Think I should try my hand at investing myself? Or keep it going with a robo?

Is complaining to the AMF about a garbage RESP fund my advisor sold me worth the effort?,"In short, in 2016 I bought a house and had my first child. My financial education at the time was non-existent. I knew what a TFSA and RRSP were and that's pretty much it. We used a financial advisor referred to us by a family member to buy some life insurances for us and our son, and open an RESP for him. In the mean time we have had two more children and opened the same RESP with the same advisor.

I realized last week that advisor is an incompetent Gollum that sold us absolute garbage. It's an IA RESP ([https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/report/fund/performance.aspx?t=0P000073VO](https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/report/fund/performance.aspx?t=0P000073VO)) that contains terrible products, performs terribly and has an astronomical MER of 3.62%.

If you factor MER and inflation I have been consistently losing money.

Obviously it's my fault for not doing my due diligence before, but I was still livid.

Nobody is who is even remotely honest or competent would suggest this fund (or any 3.62% MER fund) to invest in.

I feel like this product must pay GIGANTIC commissions that were never properly disclosed to me, and that is why he pushed that option.

I feel like if the advisor had transparently presented the commission he would get for each product he was trying to sell me, I could have made a more informed decision.

Is complaining to the AMF going to change anything? Help promote change to the industry, to force advisors to be more transparent with their earnings and conflicts of interests hidden therein.

Or would I be wasting my time?

Hope you are all well.

I have started taking a small interest into robo investors, as I feel I am more of a ""set it and forget it"" type of investor.

Big bank Chequing Fees,"Has anyone ever had any luck getting the monthly bank fees waived for their Scotiabank, CIBC etc chequing account? Scotia is currently charging me $15.95 a month. the only free options I see are if you maintain a $4000 limit, which is just not the way I prefer to budget my chequing and daily spending accounts. 

I would prefer to stay with them to avoid the anxiety and hassle of getting all my current preauthorized payments transferred. If anyone has any tips that would be appreciated!

Mortgage deferral of 4 months led to only $2000 being paid off of principle? Anyone else go through something similar and can explain this?,"TLDR : paid around $2000/month for the mortgage over 8 months. Had 4 months deferred. 1st year of mortgage payments. After the 1 year, only 2k was paid off of principle. Does this make sense?

Numbers: are altered for this example, but close.

Mortgage:400k

Estimate that about half of the $2000, goes towards principle and half towards interest.  

$8000 towards principal
$8000 in interest.

deferred $8000 worth if payments.
estimate interest owed is about $4k
estimate principle owed is about $4k.

At the very least with the deferral would expect principle to be around 396,000.

23M [Ontario] - WealthSimple & TFSA - Where to begin?,"Preface - I will probably have a lot of people shaking their heads at me but please don't judge. I am well aware I am a total newb at this so please provide constructive criticism. 
_____

What sparked this post and re-evaluating my financial portfolio was reminiscing back in 2019 when I was considering investing around $5,000 in TSLA which now would be worth around $61,500. I really haven't done much investing in my life when it comes to stocks and maximizing the use of my bank accounts. For example, I only have around $1,500 in my TFSA and my total contribution room as of January 2021 according to the CRA website is $42,400.... I know, smh. 

My TFSA account is with CIBC. From my understanding, any trades and gains of stocks from a TFSA is completely tax free? So hypothetically if I did invest my $5000 in 2019 with TSLA and sold my stocks today (through the TFSA), I'd be taking out $61,500 tax free?

 I would like to trade with my TFSA using WealthSimple and from my understanding I would need to transfer or open up my TFSA account with WealthSimple? This is going to sound stupid but it's not like e-transfers where I keep the TFSA account with CIBC and transfer or connect the account to WealthSimple to trade with is it? My goal is to put about $5,000 for now to invest with. I might consider picking up 1 - 5 blue chip stocks and then put the rest into ETFs.",3,1610127928.0,2021,2021-01-08,Investing,quotebymichaelscott,0,kt7itm

How Does a Mortgage Work? - newbie seeking advice,"I apologize if this question is silly, but I’m new to this realm of finance and don’t have many people around me that could be as helpful as I need. I have tried google, but I want to make sure I know what I’m getting into.. so I’m here for advice.. I’m sorry if these might be questions with obvious answers.

Lets say a house you want to buy is 600-700k... does the bank need to give you the exact amount or more to purchase the house? I understand there is a downpayment you place, then the bank gives you the rest.

But what if the house is 600k, you put down 50k.. does the bank need to give you 550k in order for you to get the house?

Will a bank even give someone a loan that high? Because from what I see online you need to make a certain about of money to be approved or have a co signer. So if someone is single, no debts, good credit and making 50-70k without a co signer... would they be able to get a 500-700k loan? 

I’m just confused because most online calculators say you can get approved for 250-300k with this income... but most houses are not this cheap. I don’t even know where you could even find a home or even townhouse for that much... 

Would it make a difference if this was a new built home and you are putting down the deposit first then waiting for the home to be built to start the mortgage payments? What happens if the bank doesn’t approve the mortgage once you already have put down the deposit for the new built? 

I apologize if these questions are scattered.. I really want to make the proper decision so I’m reaching out to anyone who can help. 

Thank you all for your time.",11,1610126655.0,2021,2021-01-08,,throwawaykas,2,kt72qa
Real expected return for VEQT/VGRO is 3.9/3.1% (analysis link attached) - is that enough to retire for most of us?,"Hi all,

I came across the following analysis which seems to be pretty objective and thorough:  
[https://www.canadianportfoliomanagerblog.com/ask-bender-expected-returns-for-the-vanguard-asset-allocation-etfs/](https://www.canadianportfoliomanagerblog.com/ask-bender-expected-returns-for-the-vanguard-asset-allocation-etfs/)

As someone that recently started investing, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this.

1) Do you think the analysis itself and assumptions made are accurate? (please read fully)  
2) If it is and we're looking at 3.1% actual return, should we really see VGRO/VEQT as kings and the best advice for novice investors? I understand the simplicity and the all in one ETF mindset, **which is why I myself selected it**, but I can't see how this is enough to retire comfortably. I was under the assumptions that even after market corrections/volatility/taxes/dividends/etc., we'd look at around the +5% in the long term.

3) Is %3.1-3.9 real return enough to retire for the average Canadian? 

Please please no sassy/condescending comments. I would genuinely like a healthy discussion or facts about this subject.",26,1610126461.0,2021,2021-01-08,,International-Row556,4,kt706k

Does a Non-Resident for Tax Purposes have to show foreign tax returns when returning to Canada?,"Quick backstory: I recently resolved an issue with the CRA regarding my 2018 tax return. Essentially, I moved out of Canada partway through the year and mistakenly reported foreign income from my job in Asia. I'll spare the details because I don't think they're particularly relevant, but after a year and a half of back and forth correspondence, my status was changed to Non-Resident for Tax Purposes (as of the time I left in 2018). The CRA informed me I don't need to file a Canadian tax return until I move back to Canada permanently, since I'm not making any income from Canada and still live abroad (currently in an EU country).  
I don't have any specific time when I plan on returning to Canada, although it'll most likely be in 1-3 years.

My question is, when I move back to Canada and declare myself as a resident again, will I have to prove anything about income I've made/taxes I've paid overseas?

Start investing at 40 help,"Hi everyone! I am very new at investing and i have been learning on my own in the past few months. I do have a good amount of saving roughly ( $74k TFSA, $50$ RRSP,  and about $60$ I could keep on HSA or margin acc, maybe use a bit of this to get single stocks) this does not count my emergency fund. 
My main question is I have decided I am comfortable or i d like to just use 1 ETF ticket for the ease of use. So i decided just to get VGRO. Does it matter if i use both TFSA and RRSP and get VGRO ?

Through my studying on investing I went through an exercise where I created a portfolio that would be similar to that but instead i would have to get each underlying ETF something like ( VAB, ZDB, VCN, VUN, VTI, VIU, VEE, VWO) but then someone told me for my  portfolio size the effort of rebalancing would be too much therefore then my decision to just start with VGRo and avoid the rebalancing work.

I guess it goes back to for my age, i only have 25 years of work and I am aware that i must save strongly about 30% and i dont have issues doing so.

Yet another TFSA question,"I know there are a kajllion of these already, but I'm still a little confused.

In 2019 I withdrew 40k

In 2020 I deposited 12.5k

Do I still have an additional 27.5k of contribution room (plus 12k for 2020 and 2021)? 

I keep getting caught up in people's wording, since I feel like there's a big difference between saying 'you can recontribute the withdrawal amount the following year' vs. 'you can recontribute the withdrawal amount \*starting\* the following year'. One implies you have a year to recontribute, while the latter seems like it's on ongoing thing.",4,1610120791.0,2021,2021-01-08,,Hamidak,0,kt5126
Score too low for bank loans.,"Hello! I was wondering, I'm in a bad situation financially and I was looking at options for a 1000$ loan.

Also their interest rate is insane most of the time but I'm in a situation where I do need 1000$ like yesterday to pay rent.

Help on how to proceed with RRSP over-contribution. Should I hire a fiscalist?,"Hello everyone,

I know this is my second thread on the matter, but after contacting my bank and the CRA, I thought you guys could help me how to proceed if I provided more details.

In 2020, my total contribution room for my RRSP account was **$18 909**. I had never contributed the a RRSP account before that.

On **November 19 2020**, I deposited **$15 000** in the account, wich I then invested in ETFs (following Canadian Couch Potato strategy). So far so good, I still had **$3 909** left to contribute.

However, on **December 29 2020**, I contributed again to the account for **$8 000**, due to incorrect knowledge of RRSP contribution room. I then invested it in ETFs.

That means that the amount I over-contributed is: ($15 000 + $8 000) - $18 909 = **$4 091** As the CRA permits a one-time grace of **$2 000**, my over-contribution would actually be **$2 091**.

The market value of the **$23 000** investment is now **$23 508**.


Other info: I think I won't have additional RRSP room for 2021, as my only revenue in 2020 is capital gains on bitcoin disposition, which I will correctly declare as capital gain income. The same was true for 2019 and will  be for 2021.

I have contacted Questrade and they are unable to cancel the $8 000 transaction made on December 29 2020. I have contacted the CRA, but frankly they haven't been to helpful. They sent me a couple of documents online, but there isn't a clear and detailed solution on how to proceed.


The main document is the T3012A. As I understand so far, this document is to have a permission from the CRA to withdraw the exceeding amount without it being considered as income (to avoid double imposition).

I also read that some people recommend to not wait for this permission and instead withdraw the exceeding amount directly, although I do not know the following steps.

I feel like my problem isn't too big, but I really don't want to mess things up with the CRA. Would it be a good idea to hire a accountant to help me resolve this problem?

But by all means. Die at 72 with 2 million in the bank so your grand kids can do mountains of cocaine in Vegas with their grampys cash. 

Can’t take it with you, might as well treat it like alcohol and enjoy it responsibly and excessively.

Then there’s the “you have to live in the GTA to experience fulfillment and success.” group.

The cost of living determined that was a lie. 

Turns out, you can carve a living out just about anywhere and paying huge sums of money for a apartment isn’t worth all the weird foods you can’t afford to eat because even with 6 roommates your $8000 a month rent. 

I think this sub is great if you want to lead a stable, boring life.

But getting ahead takes risk. 

Even low risk investments got hammered in March. 

Investing is just gambling anyways.

Will I be taxed in my home country if I withdraw from my TFSA?,"Hey all, 

A bit of background to the question above, I used to live in Canada but have since moved back to the UK. While in Canada I opened a TFSA and bought some shares that have since gone up a considerable amount. 

I had arranged for a UK broker to transfer the shares over but they can't because Questrade can't transfer internationally because it's a TFSA. But the catch 22 is I can't open a regular trading account with Questrade as I'm no longer in Canada.

So my main option to get them to the UK is to sell them and deposit the money in the UK bank account. However I don't want to do that because the capital gains tax is £7k!  

But because it's a TFSA, does that make the gains tax-free in the UK or just Canada? I'm guessing just Canada, but hope someone can shed some light!

WFH and Business use of Home,"So let's say I have this scenario here:

In Jan-Apr I received some contracts \[company will produce a T4A\] for some work. I used a dedicated office (room A) that's about 7-8% of the house - I claimed it as such for the previous years.

Now, since March, I've been working from home in spare bedroom **that's different than the office I used for my contracts (room B)**... I don't know the percentage of the house this room takes but but let's say 8% again.

I'm working full time in Room B and do contracts on the side in Room A

"Cash flow negative condo investment in Vancouver, good idea?","Hey r/PFCers, I'm looking for some insight and perhaps a sanity check on this situation that has presented itself to me. Disclaimer, this would be my first entry into the real estate market.

Location: Vancouver

There's a newly renovated condo that I could potentially purchase as a rental property. After doing the math on the mortgage + fees + rent, I end up cash flow negative.

Mortgage: $1650 ($500k condo)

Strata Fees: $220

Insurance: $50

Property Tax: $120

Vacancy: $100

Rent: $1600 (based on similar local postings in the area)

Cash flow: -$540 (rough estimate but in the red)


From my point of view, and to other rental property investors, this automatically is a red flag to not invest into this property. I understand that despite being cash flow negative on rental property, you can still come up profitable due to the rent paying off the principal. But to me, the opportunity cost of investing the cash I'm putting back into the mortgage is similar to just throwing it into an ETF and calling it a day. I do also value more liquid assets at this period of my life like ETFs vs. an illiquid asset like the condo. Reason being I don't plan on moving into the condo and instead purchasing in a different location, maybe in 3-5 years.

I looked into condo rental property ownership in Vancouver and it seems like most owners are in the market more for potential appreciation, rather than being cash flow positive. I know that hoping for appreciation on your property is largely speculative. I've also heard many suggest that real estate, especially in Vancouver, is an extremely safe investment as property value continues to goes up here, even for condos.

I would greatly appreciate hearing some insights from seasoned real estate owners that confirm/refute my line of thinking.

Thank you all in advance!",11,1610104178.0,2021,2021-01-08,Housing,kursain,1,kt0ey7

Managing /moving savings between banks,"Hi folks, just wanted to start off by saying how grateful I am for this thread--I am the newbiest of newbies at finances, and so grateful for everything I learn from ya'll on here. 

I'd like to take advantage of Tangerine's promo (2.10% interest in your Savings Account for 5 months) and shift (most, if not all) my savings to it, from my RBC High Interest eSavings--one of my first real financial ""moves"". I'm an MA student, working part time plus gig work, living at home due to the pandemic--since I have minimal expenses right now, I'd like to educate myself and establish some solid financial habits moving forward.

I've been reading how folks keep very little in their checking account ($1000 ish), holding most in savings accounts--but I can't shake the concern that, firstly, there's a limited number of withdrawals you can make from savings accounts, and having different accounts across different banks is risky or difficult to manage or coordinate (for bills, payroll deposits, etc.)

So, stupid question(s) time: how do ya'll do it? Do you get a payroll deposit into a checking account, pay off credit cards and any bills, then just throw the rest in various savings? Is it really that simple? Do you do it manually, or automatically? Is there actually any limit to how much you can withdraw from savings accounts (i.e. move between accounts)--is this something I should be looking out for? Should I be wary of moving my money around to take advantage of different promos?

I feel like apps like Mint (which I already use) will be helpful in managing different accounts, and am likely overthinking savings allocation, but if anyone has any first steps in this respect for an amateur, I'd appreciate it.!",17,1610100227.0,2021,2021-01-08,Banking,khftho,8,kszle1

I was planning to invest in housing so within the last two years I did not invest my money beyond guaranteed gain. As a result I now have a 150k in cash.

So I have a few questions:

Should I get a LOC to use towards a down payment and use the first time home buyer incentive to take advantage of the 5% match?

Or should I wait 5 years and save the 20% down payment without moving? I don't think I can last another year in this apartment there is a lot of crazies in my area lol.

Also I'm new to this but are we able to consolidate our LOC with our mortgage?

My current budget for a home is 250-325k and have no idea if I would qualify for that. Once I pay off my debt my credit score should be above 720.",10,1610076948.0,2021,2021-01-07,,,1,ksu7gf

"left HOOPP employer in 2020, they messed up my RRSP contribution I think (over contribution?)","I left a HOOPP employer in 2020

they gave me a package for the commuted value of my pension

on the form from HOOPP, it said 13.4k will be a direct transfer into an RRSP that I provide (and this would not affect any contribution room)

and an additional 6.6k can be transferred into an RRSP if I have the room

in 2020, my contribution limit was only 6.6k, so I told HOOPP to transfer both amounts to my RRSP

today I checked my TD contribution docs for 2020, it says the entire 20k is a new contribution into my account (there is only one slip issued stating this 20k amount), but this would mean that I over contributed since I only have 6.6k in contribution room

But HOOPP said the 13.4k would not affect my room, so I am confused who to even contact in this scenario to get this fixed?

I'm thinking of doing similar on a used mid 2010's minivan.

I'll email the one salesman I interacted with when I checked out the car, telling him I'm willing to give him a bank draft for xx amount(couple thousand less than advertised price, about 7%), conditional upon inspection at a mechanic of my choosing, at my expense. 

I will not tolerate extra fee's for freight, shipping, documentation, licensing etc, they can file all that under the price I gave them.
I am not interested in any add-on ""goodies"" such as extended warranty, etching etc. 
No haggling, BS, no trying to get me to finance or else I walk away.

Being carless at the moment(bumming rides from in-laws, got in a no-fault accident) I would want to communicate this deal mostly by email, and don't want to give them my phone number until the last moment(this group of dealerships has a real bad rep, worse than usual ---Go Auto in Edmonton).

My question to you guy's is, how well might this work out for me? would they take the easy deal? it's not like I'm offering 25% less than their advertised price.

Any tips on a.. kinder approach that I should take? not that they deserve it. 

I wouldn't say I'm desperate to buy this car, but as mentioned, carless at the moment.

RRSPs for someone who may leave Canada in the future?,"Hey all,

Need some advice..
I recently got my permanent residence in canada and thus have plans to live and work here for the foreseeable future. Currently I have no plans to leave.
I have filled my TSFA contribution space. 
now I look to see what else I can do with my savings. 
I have plans to buy an apartment in the next year. Just started looking into the process and gathering information on my local market (Montreal). 
Thanks to a lot of savings and some contribution from my parents I have (not including the tsfa) $180000.

My intention is to put a portion of this towards the buying a property, currently I am thinking around 80-90k.
This would leave me approx 100,000. 

As I am currently in the highest tax bracket my next though is to use my RRSP. My only worry with this is that as my family is all based in Europe - There is a chance that when my parents are older etc and need looking after I may end up having to move back to Europe. Who knows, cant predict the future exactly. But as I am 35 now and they are early 70s. This could happen while I am still in the work force. 
So Im thinking about the difficulties associated with leaving the country and RRSPs. 

From what I understand. My main options would be:
1)Leave the country and leave my RRSP as it is, and presumably access it when If I retire in Europe. (I believe there is no treaties to transfer this kind of thing to the UK). Missing out on continuing to use that money for compound interest.

2) Leave the country, and wait a tax year. Then take the money out of the RRSP. So then it would be taxed as income? + withholding tax.

So  based off all this I have a few questions...
Im wondering if anyone has faced this situation before and is aware of any other options that I am not aware of? Or if i have actually understood the system correctly haha! 

is there any advantage in taking the money out over the course of a few years so that the 'income' from it is not as much on the taxes?

"I had a plan for financial independance at 50, but read a reddit post saying 1 000 000 wasn't going to be worth a lot in 30 years, and now I'm not sure if my plan is good...","Hi everyone,

Pretty much what the title says.  Unfortunately, I can't find that post again, but a lot of people seemed to agree that a 1 000 000 dollars wasn't going to be ""worth a lot"" in 30 years.  Now, I doesn't take a PhD in economics to understand that a fix amount of money now is going to be worth less in 30 years, but it made me think about my plan to achieve financial independence by 50.  My plan is not to retire at that point, but have the flexibility to work less (part time), and take some time off when I want to.

Here's my plan (it includes my soon-to-be wife a little bit) :

\- Age : 27 (my fiance is 23)

\- Current assets : 60k, all invested in various forms of stocks (mutual fonds, ETF, stocks).  The mutual fonds were invested in before I learned about stocks and ETF, but I'm keeping my money there for a cash down on a house in 2-3 years.

\- Saving rate : My fiance and I are putting between 1200 and 1500$ a month together.  On my side, I'm putting an additional 300-500$ a month.  At this rate, and with what we have now, I hope we can reach 1 million together in 23 years.

\- We both have normal paying jobs, but with the luck of having a strong pension plan.  My fiance is a teacher, so in 30 years, she is looking at a good yearly pension.  In my case, if I stay at my current employer until I'm 50 (which is my plan, but I know it's not a certainty), and decide to get my pension at 55, I'm looking at +/- 30k a year for my pension.

So, my revenues at 50 in resume :

\- Part time job (on and off)

\- Pension starting at 55 for me, by the time I'm 57, my fiance could get her pension too

\- Withdrawal of savings if necessary (hoping we reached a million at 50)

\- Dividends, although I'm not counting on this too much.

&#x200B;

I guess my question is : based on that reddit post I read, does my plan still make sense?

One property for $999k or three properties for $499k?,"Looking at condo properties in the city of Toronto, within the center of the city. 

A 75k down payment can purchase a property up to $999k in purchase price. However, the same 75k could be used to purchase two properties, like one for 500k, and one for 750k, over a two year span.

To get a mortgage on a 500k property, you can buy with a minimum of $25k down, provided it's a primary residence.  To get a mortgage on an 750k property, you can buy with a minimum of $50k down, provided it's a primary residence.

If someone uses $25k to buy a 500k property as their primary residence, then one year later realizes, this place is too small, and uses the other $50k to buy a different $750k property as their primary residence and rents out the first one. Well, then they end up with two properties for their same $75k down payment, is that right? 

I imagine two condo properties in the core of the city, at the current discount rates, could be fairly decent in terms of appreciation in the next few years.

What are the pros and cons to taking this approach? Why doesn't everyone just do this?

RRSP vs TFSA -looking more in-depth or nuanced way to tell which is better,"I'm finally able to start saving/investing again this coming year, previously I was buying mutual funds within a work-matched RRSP and a TFSA. Used the RRSP to buy a house, have not contributed to either for a while. I'm going to follow a index-fund ETF strategy, but I'm unsure whether I should do that within a TFSA or RRSP.

All the articles I read are (necessarily) vague, saying that if you are in higher tax bracket than expected in retirement, use the RRSP to defer taxes, if not then use the TFSA. But they never talk about to determine that? Is there some kind of applicable math equation to help decide? Obviously there are factors like your field/career/salary, but what about accounting for future inflation/tax brackets? And predicting how much you'll be pulling from from investments and other sources? Ideally retirement income is ""as much as possible"" but who knows?

It's occurred to me as I get ready to invest again, that over the last 2-3 years that I haven't been investing I've also gotten a few significant raises, I might actually be in my ""higher income"" years now, meaning I should go with RRSP. Previous to this as a young person starting my career it was pretty obvious to go with TFSA so I never gave the decision much thought. Looking at payscale/glassdoor I seem to already be well higher than the median salary so I don't know if I can reasonably expect to increase much more. So maybe I'm overthinking this? I might just be tripping up on the mentality flip that I'm in my high-earning, not low-earning years? Is it worth considering the ""what if"" of having a different lower-paying job in the future?

Relevant info: 27yo, Estimator in Hamilton, base salary 73k, 5k bonus, 4k DPSP. Median income for estimators that I can find is 57-63k.",8,1610052326.0,2021,2021-01-07,,jonny24eh,0,ksmbv5
Wrong contribution room on CRA leading to locking in too much on a GIC in my TFSA,"Back in July 2020, my financial advisor convinced me to invest in a 3 year non redeemable GIC for my TFSA. I wasn't convinced, but she was very pushy so I decided to do it. She got my contribution room from My CRA without explaining to me how it worked or double checking the numbers with me. Just told me I had 50k contribution room. I decided to invest 30k in the GIC. This month, I decided to look into Wealthsimple and when calculating my contribution room I got a way lower number so I decided to read about it and my CRA calculated my contribution room starting from 2011 when I came to Vancouver in 2017. Apparently my CRA can be wrong about contribution rooms and they will hit you with penalties for overcontributing once they correct it eventually. I know the first thing I should do is to correct the overcontribution and talk to my financial advisor, but since its a locked in GIC I'm not sure how to proceed.

Warning - Delays in Transferring to EQ Bank from Tangerine,"All, it took 38 days to transfer funds from my TFSA with Tangerine to EQ Bank when their new TFSA HISA accounts became available. On November 29, 2020 I submitted the form to EQ Bank to transfer the TFSA. On December 16, 2020 the funds were pulled out of my TFSA with Tangerine (who charged me $50 for said transfer), then I had to wait until yesterday for those funds to actually show up in EQ Bank. 

I complained to EQ Bank via email because I kept getting disconnected while waiting on the phone to speak with an agent in late December and earlier January.  None of my inquires have been answered as of yet. 

Just a word to the wise, if you're thinking about transferring over, be prepared to wait a month or so, and it will cost you about $50 plus whatever interest you could have earned for ~1.25 months.

"Millionaire teacher book leads me to ask: Why have a global portfolio if you don't know your retirement country? Conversely, why have home-country-bias when you do know which country you'll retire in?","CLARIFICATION: My post's title includes the question:

>Why have a global portfolio if you don't know your retirement country?

I think it would have been more clear if I amended it to read:

>Why have a global portfolio **WITHOUT A BIAS FOR ANY COUNTRY (INCLUDING YOUR OWN COUNTRY)** if you don't know your retirement country?

In other words, what stumps me is not so much the call for a broadly diverse portfolio. Rather, what stumps me is the part of having a retirement-country bias if you know where you'll retire, and foregoing an ""any-country bias"" if you don't.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

Original text follows:

Currently reading Andrew Harram's book Millionaire Teacher (2nd edition). In Rule 6, he writes:

>Originally from Manchester, Paul now lives in Dubai. He isn't sure where he wants to retire, so his portfolio represents full global representation without a home country bias.  
>  
>Most UK-based investors, however, will pay their future bills in pounds. For that reason, it pays to have a home country bias.

How is it advantageous for Paul (or anyone who doesn't know what country he’ll retire in) to have a global representation without a home-country bias?

On the opposite end, for investors who know where they plan to spend their future years, why does it pay to have a home-country bias?

My newbie-level guess is that it has something to do with getting paid in your home country's currency?

These questions stem in part because I'm undecided where to spend my ""retirement years"". I'm open to sticking to Canada, but am also open to going to a third-world nation where the cost of living is much lower.",21,1610047655.0,2021,2021-01-07,,squeakyjump,11,kskmcy
Stocks in a TFSA account,"Can someone explain to me how a TFSA account works? I’m confused as I just read an article that confused the hell out of me.

confirmed by RBC)
- EXRO
- HODL

- RVV
- VSBY
- NBAC
- OCG
- PLTR

sometimes I have added shares to already bought stock and only sold once.

Looking for advice. Consumer proposal issue.,"Hey everyone. so, as the title suggests, I am looking for some advice on how best to handle this really frustrating and strange issue. Back in 2015 I filed a consumer proposal to get my crappy financial situation in a better place. I did everything I was supposed to, all payments were made, after 4 years, I was discharged and was done. I was on my way to getting my financial house in order. 

**My mistake** I never bothered to check my credit reports. I assumed everything was fine. Now that my wife and I are looking into buying our first home and pulled my report. My credit score is a lot lower than I thought it would be. Going through it, I found an entry from a creditor that I know and can prove was included in my proposal. 

**my actions taken** First thing I did was open a dispute with Equifax to have it removed. after waiting the almost month to hear back, they told me they could not reach the creditor and I should pursue having the entry removed myself through them. This sounded weird to me but I figured OK I'll try. So, I call the creditor and explain what's going on. give him the account number, the amount ""owed"" and the company. He tells me that while he sees the file, it shows as no money owed. so after I ask well why is this still on my Equifax? he said he has no idea and referred me back to the original company. Now, before I called them I called my insolvency trustee and explained what was going on. now, they have told me that due to how long i have been discharged, they cannot do anything to help me with calls or emails to Equifax of the collections company. I was provided a contact to someone who has experience dealing with this. While I am going to reach out to them, I really dont feel like I should have to pay for something that should have been cleared off once I completed my part of the proposal. 

**what I'm looking for** Advice on how I can go forward, I really want this resolved ASAP (naturally) i've done what I needed to to correct my mistakes. does anyone have any contacts or departments at Equifax or suggestions on how I can get this resolved?

Thanks a lot in advance for your help.

I am considering moving to the US for work in the next ~1-5 years - Things to keep in mind around investments and taxation?,"I am a Canadian currently working in Canada but I am aiming to move to the US for work (tech/software engineering) within the \~6 months to 5 years, starting on a TN visa and possibly progressing to H1-B but not currently considering US Citizenship. I want to ensure that my investment decisions today factor in the possible future consequences of such a move, primarily with regards to taxation. I expect to remain in the US for a number of years, but could see myself returning to Canada later in life, as well as retiring in Canada. Most Canadian financial literature on investing and taxation is for Canadians in Canada, and while I have been digging through many [Canada.ca](https://Canada.ca), RBC Wealth Management, etc pages, there are entire careers built on this and I am hoping for an abbreviated version from someone that has gone through a similar process.

Personal context:

* Current income in Ontario: CA$110k
   * TFSA is maxed out
   * RRSP ???
      * myCRA is down right now, but I'd estimate 1/4 of my contribution room used. I had been saving contribution room until I was in a higher income bracket, which in retrospect may have been a bad idea but still not sure
   * EQ Savings has \~30% of my net worth
      * I know, not ideal, which is why I want to figure out a plan and put some of that into better investments
   * US bank chequing account has \~30% net worth sitting in US$
      * Again, not ideal. As this is already in US$, I'd like to invest this into US$ instruments to avoid a double currency conversion. Plan is to move it into a Canadian US$ account (within a TFSA/RRSP/etc) ASAP.
* Expected US  income: US$160k/CA$200k ($120 base rest in stock)  starting, US$300k in 10 years. Most likely NY, Washington, or California.

Questions:

* I want to invest my available cash. As my TFSA is maxed, should I be using my RRSP room first or a non-registered/taxable account?
* If I move my US$ back to a Canadian US$ account, should I keep a US bank account (and US credit card) open for credit history? I have great credit in Canada and good credit in the US. My current accounts are through RBC US Bank and have a small monthly charge.
* I am very interested in acquiring investment properties, either in Canada, the US, or both. I may also inherit Canadian properties in the next few years. How would that factor in? Timelines are unclear as property acquisitions may happen in the next few months before moving, or in a few years after moving.

"Quebec realtors: With the new ""4 weeks"" lockdown now, how strongly do you think the market will be affected?","So I put my condo up for sale back in late September with the hopes of purchasing a house for our expanding family. But then our government announced a 28 day lockdown. We were worried about not finding any houses available so we took our condo off the market. But now, Quebec decided to extend that lockdown to the beginning of February, and who knows, they'll probably extend it again after that.

We were really looking forward to putting our condo back on the market this month. Even missed a few opportunities and interesting potential houses during the past few months. It only really slowed down to somewhat of a halt in mid/late December. So I'm asking, in your opinion, do you think the housing market will still be active during this new lockdown? Do you think it would be safe to put the condo back on the market or wait a big longer?

My mortgage is up for renewal in late June. So, in a perfect world, I would like to sell my condo right away and buy a decent house asap. We're not even looking for a place to spend the rest of our lives in, just something slightly bigger to accommodate the family. But who knows what could be available during these times. There's also the option of waiting a bit longer and taking an open mortgage. But I'm tired of waiting and just hoping for the best. The contract with our realtor also ends in September.

Dividends vs. growth stocks vs. all-in-ones,"I'm only just beginning to look into dividends, but I'm wondering if someone could help me out with understanding their importance or lack thereof in a TFSA.

If we take something that's a relative safe bet (XGRO) and pit it against an unpredictable growth stock, the outcome it pretty self-explanatory. It could go either way.

But then there's something like Enbridge, which seems to have a large dividend dividend yield. Do high dividend yields have the potential to trump predictably growing (or predictably falling) all-in-ones or growth stocks? It's my understanding that dividends are money that doesn't go back into the company.

At what point do people start to feel guilty about buying investment properties?,"In 20 years every rural town is going to just be rental properties, because every yahoo with a downpayment wants to get in the ""game"", its a throw in the bucket but those people that are adding their 2nd, 3rd, 4th, ha 5th ""investment"" property should really consider the harm your collectively creating. That the economics of these areas were priced to allow someone in some rural part of a Canada to afford a house, though now going out of reach or being bought up so quickly that it barely makes the market.

I can’t seem to find an accurate tax calculator or one that shows me the actual breakdown - any suggestions?,"Hi everyone, I am trying to setup my spreadsheets to calculate my taxes, so that I can forecast as well as play around with the numbers (e.g., to see what the impact would be of a new job with a higher salary, etc.). 

So I found the 2021 tax brackets for ON and FEDERAL, but when I put my gross salary in and figure out the marginal taxes based off that, it doesn’t align with what is actually being taken off my cheque each month...

I tried to then use the ON/FED “net claim amounts” to take off to top of my gross salary and then put that in the marginal tax brackets, not sure if that’s how it works? but it’s still not right...

I tried to use the online calculators but again they don’t match up to what is being taken off my cheque, and they don’t show the “math” of how they are calculating it?

Is there a website where it shows the detailed breakdown of how the taxes are calculated, so that I can mirror those calculations in my spreadsheet?

Is there a way to end the water heater rental scam?,"I recently bought my house with a rental heater, fully aware of the consequences.  It seems to me that very rarely do people actually want these heater rentals.  And yet (and I may be wrong) they are often applied to new builds to the benefit of everyone but the consumer.  Is there a legal way to end this practice (class action? political?) And is there a desire to do so, in your opinion?

Edit: moderator suggested I add the province: ON

Additional info: I took over an old contract. I called enercare and they can't even find proof that they have equipment in my house.  It was being escalated, and I was planning on calling them up again to see where it's at.  

I just find it strange that someone can be on the hook for a contract they had no part of.

Edit 2:. It seems to me, those who are ok with paying for rentals are paying under $20/month.  While some others are paying $50/month (for tankless, most people don't want tankless).  I myself am paying $33/month.  The point of my post was not to seek help for myself, I'm not happy about my situation, but I'm ok with it.  I don't think it's justified for someone to have to pay $50/month for a rental they didn't sign up for.  I think this needs to change and what I really want is tips on how to make this happen.

Leasing then buying vs. financing a car,"Interestingly enough, among all the discussions here, it seems no one mentioned a lease to own option.
A friend of mine suggested rather than financing a new car to lease it first and then buy it with cash or a home-equity line of credit (low, under 3% interest).

Pros:
- you have 2-4 years test drive of the car to decide does it fit your needs
- after the lease is over, you are buying a used car with known maintenance history
- the price at which you're buying the car is lower compared to similar used cars from the other dealers
- compared to the financing, during the lease term, you pay interest on the depreciation of the car, not the full car value

Cons:
- you probably have to do the oil-changes at your dealer's place, but the maintenance of a new car (oil changes mostly) is almost the same price compared to independent garages

So what do you guys think?

"Working remotely as an employee for a US university, remotely from Ontario","Hi everyone, I have two quick questions. I’ve googled a little but I’d be grateful for any personal experiences of how much of a pain this is, tax wise.

I’m planning to work for a US company remotely from my home in Canada (Ontario in case it makes any difference) and I wonder if anyone has any recommendations about how to deal with taxes. I’d be an employee, not an independent contractor.

Then when I obtain my W2, I need to translate it to CAD and do my taxes with it.

Considering a lateral career move to Calgary from Vancouver for better standard of living. Do it make sense ?,"I am an intermediate electrical engineer working for an electric utility in Vancouver. I have a job offer from an electric utility in Calgary. same career level, similar job roles/responsibilities and a similar salary. The cost of living and housing in Calgary is very attractive for the same pay as compared to Vancouver. 

With my current employer I might be able to get a long awaited promotion later this year where as in the newer offer, I would be expected to continue in the same role for another 3-4 years. 

I am getting tempted at the cost of living in Calgary and housing, though all my friends are in Vancouver and I’m not used to the winter, even Vancouver feels cold to me. 

While Vancouver is amazing and all, I am really  tired of living frugally and saving for that downpayment for that first home. Even if I get that promotion later this hear, it might not make a lot of difference in my living standards here in metro Vancouver. 

I would appreciate feedback or suggestions from anyone who have made a similar move or from electric utility employees in Calgary.

My TFSA accounts are all over the place. How do I switch to VEQT and VEGRO?,"At first, I went with Wealthsimple because it was easy to set up and it had the most user-friendly interface. Later as I realized the fees were adding up, I opened a 2nd account with Questrade, just about getting ready to transfer my account from Wealthsimple. But just before I did that, I opened a 3rd TFSA account with Wealthsimple Trade because I thought, ""Hey wtf, I'm only gonna use this account for VEQT and VEGRO anyway. So Trade is actually the better option for me.""

BUT I just realized 2 things. One, I can't transfer from Wealthsimple Invest to Wealthsimple Trade. Two, even if I could, transferring would probably mean selling my existing list of holdings and reinvesting that cash into VEQT and VEGRO. In that case, is it still worth switching? Would it be cheaper than the commission fees I would continue to pay in the long-term? (I only started 3 years ago so maybe it's not too late to switch.)

CEBA STATUS - CANCELED BY TD - TD SAYS APPLICATION UNDER REVIEW BY CRA ...HELP ME,"TL:DR.  CRA says application canceled td says application under review by CRA. CRA says did not receive the application from TD. 

FULL VERSION (LONG)

After multiple attempts to get CEBA funding since the October expansion with multiple reasons all related to documents. 

December 5th I completed the application (through td) and then uploaded documents with a CEBA rep on phone. 

December 8th received email from td saying application still being reviewed.

December 9th CEBA launches online status updates 

December 9 I check my status----Cancelled---- contact your financial institution for further information. The date of cancelation is also Dec 9th. Immediately on phone with td rep who says no the application is still under cra review.  I inform her that no the CRA update says canceled.  She states that its not within TD capabilities to cancel. She escalates the call and tries to transfer me to loyalty but no one answers, after several attempts to get through she tells me that she will have a call back requested, I will receive a call back in the next one to three business days. 

I hang up and get on phone with ceba to get a callback, within 10 mins CRA rep calls back, I explain that td says its not canceled and its under review. The CRA agent confirms the website information but provides a bit more information as she indicates that they have received all of my documents and all have been accepted, but the application was canceled by TD she further provides that it appears as though the cancelation was automatic as soon as it was submitted they canceled it. So she informs me that I have to deal with TD because as far as CRA is concerned they have the documents but are still awaiting an application. 

So there's 2 problems with this so far....the application was submitted on the 5th prior to uploading of documents,  but for whatever reason TD initiated the application to CRA but automatically canceled it but not until the 9th. 

I called TD again as I still hadn't heard back to get another agent insisting that no its not canceled its still under CRA review, I explained all the above information to her and she still insisted that its under review. Escalated to a shift manager who just regurgitates the same spiel to me. 

December 12th yet again I'm calling TD  as no loyalty reps have contacted me go through the same explanation yet again with some argumentative condescending gentlemen to finally be transferred to a manager who I yet again get to explain everything again and received the same spiel yet again. But he assures me its still under CRA review but he will email loyalty because apparently there was never going to be a call back as they do not do outbound calling nor do they have inbound calling. Apparently the only way to contact this department who handles CEBA is via email...in the year 2020...what a joke.  

Dec 17th A week goes by and nothing no contact from anyone, I'm losing my shit at this point. Call td and again the same bullshit as above no no its under review still our loyalty department did an investigation and its under review tell the client to wait 5 more business days...this was dated the 10th of December its now the 17th. I explain that to the rep that its already beyond 5 days. He escalates to manager yet again and rinse and repeat the above process. I tell manager look i don't care if you say application is under review and let's say for the sake of arguing that CEBA is lying to me about them not having an application to review, just cancel the application so I can  re apply I really don't care its that simple cancel the application.  He says he can request that be done but doesn't know if or when it would be done... Did I mention its the year 20 fucking 20 and one of Canadas largest financial institutions can't communicate interdepartmentally nor are they capable of properly canceling an application...

Dec 22 I call ceba again and am informed without a shadow of doubt there is absolutely no application under review of any sort currently. They still have my accepted documents and are awaiting an application. Awesome. I call td and go through the same nonsense as every previous encounter, except I've exhausted my patience and chewed a strip of the person who would only repeat scripted responses to me and was subsequently hung up on.

It should be noted that on December 12th I said fuck it and tried to submit another application through td, but alas instantly it was rejected by td as I already currently have an application being processed under review. Fml right?


Dec 24th I call TD again same spiel nonsense but this time I get a manager who seems to care  and looks at the history and the 3 responses from their loyalty investigations that are 3 exact messages verbatim ""Application under review instruct client to wait x business days..."" 
This manager Princess says "" look I usually defend the banks position in all matters but even I can see this is ridiculous and to be honest I don't believe the loyalty department at this point, so I'm going to email them and say look I want to know what's going on the client needs to know what's going on and i don't want the same response back as the last 3 messages. The thing is today is my last day before going on vacation but someone from my office as all managers are cc'd on communications as soon as a response comes in will contact you at the latest by Tuesday. 
Well this is great maybe we are getting somewhere. 

Dec 30, after not receiving a call from td again on Tuesday I call and explain everything again and get the same response again...get transfered to a manager ...again except this guy is Princess's coworker Josh and he is helpful in so far as to look into it see that loyalty has not provided a response and that he will email them again to expedite the process. He assures me he will call me back. By the end of week if not earlier. 

Jan 1st 1:30am I receive the automated email from TD saying my application is still under review and if approved won't receive any further communication etc

Jan 4 still having heard back call td and Yada Yada get transfered to a manager.

"Is ""work"" being devalued by rising asset prices?","In his 2013 book ""Capital in the Twenty-First Century"" Piketty predicted a future where capital will appreciate much faster than the cost of labour (i.e. wages and salaries). It seems today that for many people they can already see it in their own lives. Tons of people are getting rich via Tesla options, Bitcoins (it just surpassed $47,000 CAD recently), and other speculative investments. Others are getting rich via leveraging real estate purchases.

Most of my friends have heard about ""financial independence, retire early"" movement (FIRE). In fact, some of those most interested in FIRE are physicians and lawyers -- people who've actually spent quite a while training for their careers.

1. Is the value of ""work"" as a path to financial success being devalued and replaced by investing? Why spend so much time training and working hard to advance your career when you can instead look for the next Bitcoin or Tesla in your spare time?
2. If 1. is true, then that's the implication for society? Is it good for society that have lots of people in their 40s and 50s investing capital instead of working?",217,1609995239.0,2021,2021-01-06,,,206,ks60yl

Why do we pay into CPP if we may never be able to claim it?,"One piece of common financial advice seems to be that people should not count on programs like CPP/OAS in the future as a source of retirement income as they may be exhausted by the time we reach the the age to be eligible to draw it. If that reality is possible, why then are we paying into it? I don't quite like the idea of funding someone else's retirement by having money taken from my pay each week only to be left holding the bag when my turn comes. Is there some aspect of this equation I'm missing or is everyone responsible simply crossing their fingers and hoping for the best while kicking the can down the road? I assume there is no definite answer to this question at the moment and that perhaps some other program will be developed as a replacement, but I'm hoping someone here can shed some light on the matter one way or another.

Do Automated Speed Enforcement affect auto insurance? (ON),"Evening all,

It seems my municipality recently installed an automated ticket camera in one of it's hamlets.  I was unaware of this and quite surprised getting a ticket mailed to me with a photo of my car lol.  I take this route daily on my commute and I was dinged going 62km/hr in a 50km zone @ 6:30am lol.  $60 fine, total cost including fees is $80.

Gives me three options...1. Plead guilty and pay.  2. Meet with a Prosecutor.  3. Go to trial.  I was driving, likely going with option #1.

Wondering if anyone has had experience with these and did this affect your auto insurance rates?  My insurance is closer to a manageable level these days.  I had two dumb at fault accidents 6 years ago in my 20s.  I was looking forward having those dropped on my insurance renewal this year. 

My brief research seems to indicate these automated tickets don't go on your driving record because it's hard to conclusively prove who was driving the car.  Is this correct?",5,1609982180.0,2021,2021-01-06,Auto,Ryguy0327,0,ks24it
Non-Qualified Position in TFSA help,"Hey guys,

1. sell the position and pay taxes on the gains

What would you do to get ahead?,"So I’m struggling with a dilemma.  It requires a bit of an explanation so please bear with me:

My husband and I live in a small town in SW ON about 1 hr (+60 km) from our jobs. We bought our house on a power of sale (ie - CHEAP) 8 years ago and can sell now for a substantial profit.  We bought a recreational property in 2019 and spend the majority of our free time there. It takes 4-5 hours to get there from our current home.  

I’m considering selling and buying a house closer to work and to the cottage.   The dilemma is two fold—first while we will sell for a 300k profit we will have to buy another property in the range of 500-550k!  Am I crazy for looking at such a cost?  We both have high paying and secure jobs. 

After paying off our house mortgage we will have enough to pay off the cottage mortgage completely. Currently I hold a private mortgage with an interest rate at 3.6%.   It was decent rate at the time of purchase, but now with the rates so low, it’s now excessive. 

So do I move? (I have a love/hate relationship with where we currently live). It’s a cute small town, free of crime and picturesque but it’s far from everything for me (family/work/life). But it’s cheap to live here.  Commuting costs kill us. We both drive 2 hours (there/back) to work every shift.

And if we move and get enough to pay off the cottage, should we do that or put it down on the new house and have a smaller mortgage there?  I don’t know if saving the interest would be worth the savings for an uninsured mortgage and/or payments.  

We plan to retire up north in 10-13 years. Our hope is to sell our home to pay for the rebuild of our dream home/cottage up there.

Using PLOC for potential car purchase- did I miss anything??,"Hello PFC!

I am currently looking to upgrade my old vehicle for personal reasons. 

Background - My common law spouse starts a job shortly and doesn't have the same income/savings I do as she's currently in school. In order to help her out, she has agreed to purchase my current vehicle for the dealer trade in value. Yes, I know I could get more via private sale but I don't want to go through the hassle and I do want to help her out

Anyway, I work at a Big Bank and basically got instantly approved for 2 options.. Either a traditional auto loan or a Personal Line of Credit. I'm leaning towards the PLOC option for financing due to the following:
1) the interest rate for staff is crazy low 
2) I can EASILY afford the minimum payment and throw as much money as possible at it after the fact. I have no other debt besides our mortgage 
3) I can use said PLOC for anything my heart desires after 

Am I missing anything? I'm not buying a new vehicle and don't plant on spending more than $25K.

NSLSC charged me when I'm still in school,"I applied for my loan in September, and my school caused delay in the process (even though I called them numerous times to get it done) 

and later they eventually sent my confirmation of enrollment in December so I was in repayment until then, and was also charged fees (repayment and interest, and daily interest). 

So I called NSLSC to reverse the fees, and they said they can't. 

I mean, although they received the confirmation in December, it’s my school that caused the delay, NOT me. I explained them about this a few times but they still say that the fees are still required and I can't get any refund, which is just bs.

Expected Strata Fees: $210

Expected Condo Insurance: $60

Expected Property Tax : $120

This is my first real estate purchase so I don't have much knowledge on this and hoping to gain some insight. Thanks",10,1609974881.0,2021,2021-01-06,,incendio23,0,krzscu
Beginner Question: How do I make the most of my situation?,"I am finishing up my Masters and want to get serious about my finances. I've been very fortunate/privileged, taken that for granted, and probably missed a lot of opportunities to improve my financial situation. So now I'm at the ""second best time to plant a tree"".

I'm currently living with my parents with very little expenses (Phone, car insurance that is paid annually in June, Spotify and Audible), and they have said I can stay even once I start working to save some money, which I'm very grateful for. That being said, the minute moving out becomes a financially sound decision, I would like to have my own space. My current situation is:

Age: 29Province: Ontario - may relocate for work

Salary: Unemployed (Currently looking but between 50-70k)

**Simplii Financial**

TFSA: $2221 (2021 Contribution Room - $73 591.58) - No idea what the interest rates are, I received about $7 in interest in the last year

High-Interest Savings Account: $1610

Chequing: $150

**CIBC -** Opened a student chequing account as Simplii wasn't able to take some Canada Savings Bonds that had matured. The bank person tried to sign me up for a CIBC Visa card. I never returned the signed paper work, but a CIBC Visa showed up in the mail. I never activated the card, and the online dashboard still prompts me to activate the card.

**Student Loans - Repayment Date is Dec 31, 2021**

Canada Student Loan - $12151

Ontario Loan - $1480

**Questions:**

Finding employment is an obvious priority, other than that where should I begin? What opportunities would you encourage me to pursue?

Until seeing a post on here I was one of those suckers who didn't know TFSA's could be invested, how can I make the most of my TFSA and when should I be doing that?

Opinion on house affordability,"I am 40, single and looking to purchase my first home in ON. Am comfortable renting but with my age and real estate market I fear being priced out altogether.

Base Salary: 98K / Bonus: approx 10K

Investments = 145K

\- Non registered: 33K

\- TFSA: 30K

\- RRSP: 82K 

Cash = 159K

\- Non registered: 125K

\- TFSA: 4K

\- RRSP: 30K (HBP) 

Was thinking of going max 525K with 105K down payment and then closing costs. I have been pre-approved for 408K mortgage with a big five bank last year but my pay has increased a bit this year and broker should be able to get a bit more or I can make a bigger down payment.

Once house is in order I will start investing more in my TFSA. Want to use the HBP since I can then maximize my TFSA.

"I bought my first home last year, would I realistically be seeing any loss if I made the decision to upgrade to a nicer place soon?","I bought a townhouse in February last year. I decided to play it safe and buy a cheap property to start with as I was still 4 years away from getting permanent status in my government job. With a 25 year mortgage and a 40% down payment, my payments are very easy to keep up with, on average I have about $900 extra cash per month after all expenses.

Things changed in the last year for the better though, my job reduced the number of years to secure permanent status, and I'm soon to receive my next annual contract that will get me there. So I feel much more comfortable taking on a much larger debt load. Plus I got a small but unexpected raise outside of my regular annual raise which helps a bunch.

I don't hate my townhouse, but ultimately I want to go for a freehold house, and I figure the sooner I get my foot in the door the better. And I'd rather the freedom to spend my strata fees on other investments like mortgage prepayments. I know strata goes towards maintenance so it's not a total loss, but I'd still like to cut that out.

I'm mostly lost when it comes to how the sale impacts me exactly. If in theory I were to turn around and sell my townhouse right now and the market value and sale price were the same as when I got it, would I be seeing a loss, or just break even?",8,1609974471.0,2021,2021-01-06,,Regnes,1,krzng3
Cost to purchase condo in GVA as first time home buyer and timeline,"I made a previous post about living expenses in GVA in 2020. And many comments were congratulating me on my new condo purchase so I thought I should share how much it costs me to purchase and ongoing expenses and the timeline. Hopefully encourage folks and demystify the process for *first time home buyers.* 

* Day 0 - Work with mortgage broker over several months to see what I can afford
* Day 1 - View home with Realtor
* Day 2 - Realtor drafted offer for 'Contract of Purchase and Sale"" and I (buyer) signed it
* Day 3 - Realtor drafted 'Counter offer' to seller
* Day 4-5 - Signing paper work back and forth with seller
* Day 6 - Connect with Home Insurance companies for quotes
* Day 8 - Home Inspection - ($650)
* Day 11 - Met with Lawyer to review paperwork and paid legal fees ($1,700) and apparently Notary is cheaper.
* Day 12 - Drop off down payment to Realtor ($15,000)
* Approx 4-6 weeks later - Completion of Sale
* Day after ""Completion Date"" is ""Possession Date"" - Move in fee ($200)

Other expenses 

* Property tax - $749 (paid annual)
* Utilities (heat, electric, annual utilities) = $872 (ongoing throughout the year, will vary based on usage)
* Internet / cell phone / cable = not included since it varies for everyone.
* Other unexpected costs: Plumber ($300), furniture/moving ($500), maintenance repair ($500)

And yes there are affordable homes in this price range in GVA.

Possible to avoid quarterly tax instalments?,"In 2020 I worked two jobs overlapping for some time (assumed COVID would lead to the termination of one job but that never happened). I did some rough calculations and figure I’ll owe about 8k in taxes for 2020 after maxing out RRSP, and from reading online it looks like anything greater than 3k will trigger CRA asking me to pay tax in instalments quarterly (I’m in ON).

If I pay a lump sum to CRA of say 6k now, when I go to file my tax returns will it show as the amount owed is 2k, and so quarterly instalments would be avoided? Or is that impossible now that the calendar year has flipped?

Canadian living in the US with work visa- what are my options for investing and retirement?,"I have lived in the US for more than 10 years now, as a student (F-1 visa) and now worker (TN). Now that I am more seriously looking at retirement and investment options, it's hard for me to gauge what is applicable to my situation. I'd appreciate some advice or guidance.

**About me:**

* 28 y/o, single, 125k salary, no debt
* I've only recently started contributing to a 401k plan (10k in 2020)
* I have 70k in savings, about 5k in stocks

This year, I plan to max my 401k contribution. I'm interested in a Roth IRA and Brokerage account with Vanguard to start a portfolio but I'm not clear if I am a non-resident alien or if I meet the substantial presence test. I'm also interested in moving some of my savings a high yield savings account as a emergency fund.

What I am not able to get a clear answer about is whether I am able to open any of these types of accounts. If not, should I consider changing my USD savings to CAD, or using a Canadian bank to hold the USD? I've seen that Tangerine bank is doing a promotion with a 2.10% savings rate, should I consider that as a potential option?

I am not certain I will be living in the US when I retire or plan to leave, is there anything I can do to secure my future or maintain ties to Canada? I am worried that because I haven't been living in the country as an adult and won't have any retirement or other benefits from the government.

Lastly, would you recommend a financial advisor in my situation? I am relatively new to all of this, which makes it more complicated factoring in my visa status.

Leaving Company Pension Options,"Hey all,

Burner account here, I'm leaving my current job - moving to another one.

I have the standard 3 options:

1) Keep my deferred pension

2) Transfer to LIRA - $123k goes into LIRA the rest I get in cash less applicable withholding tax ($127k)

3) Transfer to my new employers plan.

I currently make $100k and have about $50k in TFSA and about $20k in RRSP. I own a house already.

Does anyone know what type of tax I would have to pay on the cash payment?

Condo owner needing advice for dealing with management.,"My condo's window started cracking on its own, due to the building shifting in weight. The building is only 2 years old.

Being unlucky as I am, only the interior pane of this double pane window is cracked. Even still, the inside pane is almost completely cracked now and letting in the cold.

 The building's management and the developers are refusing to do anything about it, citing a loophole that they are only liable when exterior windows are cracked. ""Exterior"" meaning must be the exterior pane.

Is there anything I can do about this?
I'm worried if I pay for my own window replacement, the management will have an excuse to never be responsible for it again, even if the building's weight shifts and shatters both panes in the future.

Long story short, after wasting many hours I still don't have a US TD account. The reps gave me the following reasons:

1) We cannot verify your identity without a US social security number (even though some told me that simply having Canadian passport would suffice)
2) You already have a USD account with TD.(This comes from all TD Canada reps both on the phone and in person, they seem to not know what I was talking about even when I showed them the cross-border plan webpages).

I recently posted about wanting to take more control of my own investments. As a result, I'm having to educate myself a lot about this world; indeed, a few months ago, I couldn't tell you the difference between a TFSA and RRSP; today, however, I am eager to learn and finally educate myself about investing! Exciting!

1) I'm reading a lot about people buying and selling using Wealthsimple, Questrade, Canadian Couch Potato, and/or Vanguard. Are these  essentially the same services - an online platform that allows you to build investment portfolios? Please correct me if I am wrong. Furthermore, if these do indeed fulfill the same function, then what is the difference between them?

2) The term ""Index Fund"" is an umbrella term used to describe ""baskets of multiple investments"" correct (like the S&P500)? Mutual Funds and ETFs are therefore *types* of index funds, correct?

3) Other than the way ETFs are traded, and these funds being a bit more liquid, what is the difference between an ETF and a Mutual Fund?

I got my hands on a lump sum of money and got overly excited and accidentally (might have) over-contributed to my RRSP.

My TFSA was maxed at the end of 2019 so I started contributing to my RRSP in 2020.

I had about 10k RRSP allotment on my 2019 notice of assessment. I was making regular contributions, until about November when I had a lump sum of money and dumped it in my self directed quest trade RRSP.

So I'm about 8k over now. 

It's now 2021 so can it be applied to this year's RRSP contribution as it's a new year? I made the over contribution in November 2020.

I also realize my employer has a pension plan that would take pension adjustments. It's a defined benefit plan. I tried Googling how the pension adjustment is calculated, it's (9x""annual accrued benefit"")-600. How do I know what the annual accrued benefit is?

Another layer to take into account: my 2018 T4 from my previous employer reported $2500 pension adjustment when I only contributed $300 before I terminated my employment. It's gonna take some time to get an amended T4 but technically I have that $2500 contribution room because it was an error... 

I called the CRA and she was pretty clueless.

What should I do?
What should I consider when withdrawing the RRSP over-contribution? I found out quest trade has a ""deregistration fee"" for withdrawing RRSP so I want to avoid that if possible... Is it possible?

Retirement planning software,"Hello,

What do y'all know about/use for retirement planning software for personal use? I'm referring to DIY simulators and calculators that allow you to enter all sources of income and retirement expenses, and offer scenarios for when and how much to withdraw.

I appears that some retirement planning software designed for Canadians is no longer available. This includes  RRIFmetic (domain is now for sale) and [http://www.retireware.com/](http://www.retireware.com/) (no longer offering new subscriptions). Vanguard offers an [(American-based) tool](https://investor.vanguard.com/calculator-tools/retirement-income-calculator/?APP=PEC&headerId=vgn-globalHeader&vgnDataSource=https:%2F%2Fapi.vanguard.com%2Frs%2Fcfv%2Fparticipant-global-nav-webservice-v1-production%2Fpublic%2Fnavigation&resourceScriptUrl=https:%2F%2Fccc.vgcontent.info%2Fvg-vgn%2Flatest%2Fjs%2Fvgn.min.js). 

Others, like [https://cascadesfs.com/](https://cascadesfs.com/) and this one by [https://www.gobeilretire.ca/](https://www.gobeilretire.ca/) offer personal use software for a small fee. There are lots of open spreadsheets and tools such as the ballparkinator^(TM) and others from [John Robertson](http://www.holypotato.net/?page_id=583).  

I'd like to hear what others are available and if there's any summary/review for the most flexible and easy to use Canadian program.

Identity theft: family member partially fell for the SIN scam,"Today my brother, who is mentally challenged, got a phone call on his cell phone. His number is unlisted, being a cell phone, but they (apparently) had his full name. He gave them his address, but got confused by whatever else they were asking for. He brought the phone over to me, and as soon as I heard the description I knew it was a scam.

I demanded identification, and the person gave me some random number in a (sigh) foreign accent. (Where I work, many people speak with that accent.  However it was pretty clear the caller's English wasn't very good.) I hung up and firmly told my brother to never talk to anyone about that.

He told me he didn't give his date of birth, SIN or banking information to them.

What are the next steps? The US version of this subreddit has an identity theft ""kit"" but I didn't see one here.

Inheritance of a Pension - Fill the RRSP?,"My girlfriend is inheriting a pension (on top of some life insurance and the sale of a home in ON) and has a choice to either continue the pension as it was (monthly payment of $858 for another 132 periods), or to take a lump sum ($108k). Either way, this to my understanding is all taxable income, and she has previously  always been in lower tax brackets.

My assumption is its a smarter move to take the lump sum and invest it to grow, even in a simple index fund. My question is does it make the most sense to fill her RRSP (basically empty right now) for both 2020 and 2021, and then fill her TFSA? Including the other inheritance sources it seems like the TFSA will get filled regardless. In the short term (6 months) I could see a lot of this money being used to buy a property in BC.

How does this sub feel about investing in cryptocurrencies?,"Hello PFC, 

My question for you is how do you feel about investing your hard earned cash in cryptocurrencies, rather than the typcial ETF?

My group of friends work in the banking industry (myself I work in tech) and they all seem to love crypto. A few of my friends in particular seem to be investing more and more in crypto each day, and they always like to brag about how much they will make when their popular picks grow to enormous heights.

I started my interest in investing about a year ago, and since have expanded my portfolio with the typically recommended total market weighted ETFs and such.

Should I start considering cryptocurrency as another investment to add to my portfolio? Is crypto really as promising as my friends make it out to be?

Tenant Buying Property I Own,"I own a property currently in a major city in Alberta that has had a great tenant for the last 4 years or so.

Is there any way or system that could work out for both of us. I've done some reading on rent to own properties which sound like a scam for the buyer usually. We have a pretty good relationship and I'd like to help him out if possible, but ideally without exposing myself to any risk. I was currently considering reducing his rent or putting it into a lawyer held trust and adding that onto the purchase price of house once he qualifies for a mortgage. But I'm sure there are some holes for that, especially if he backed out at some point.

How to calculate the re-contribution room of a USD withdrawal from a TFSA?,"I had to make a small withdrawal from my TFSA before the end of the year, in USD, and now I'm trying to figure out what my contribution room is in 2021 (beyond the CAD 6,000 limit).

As such, I was wondering how I calculate the CAD equivalent for re-contributing money to my TFSA when I have withdrawn from it in USD in the previous year. For example:

\- I withdraw USD 100.00 from my TFSA on December 26th at a rate of 1.28

\- I want to re-contribute that money back into the TFSA on January 10th when the USD-CAD rate is 1.27

Is my re-contribution room on January 10th CAD 128 or CAD 127 or something else entirely?

Also, can I just re-contribute exactly $100 to the USD side on January 10th instead?

Looking for advice on RRSP and TFSA,"Hi all, first time poster here. I have some questions on what I should do to start saving for my future.

I'm 28 married with a son, my wife is in the Military and will have a pension through them, but at this point I have nothing towards retirement. I have a few questions.  Our mortgage was paid off this year, and our only debt is two vehicles, a travel trailer and an atv. One of the vehicles is going to be paid off this July. Some friends and family have told me it would be a good idea to ""pull equity"" from the house and use that to max out my RRSP contributions since I haven't ever contributed. Wondering if this is a good idea or not.

My other question is my employer is offering an RRSP program as well, I believe with a max of 1% match starting, although to enroll in the program I'd lose out on my three paid sick days. In my mind, at my current hourly rate of 25.50, the sick days would be more than the contribution so to me it makes more sense to keep the sick days. The only benefit would be having the deductions taken off the pay cheque lowering my taxable income. 

Also at this point as well, I have a savings of $5000. My original thought was to invest $2500 into a RRSP to start towards retirement and to take advantage of the offer TD bank has right now. Would it be wise to start a TFSA at the same time?",10,1609949671.0,2021,2021-01-06,,MikeZ777,5,krqxok

Considering quitting job and going back to/focusing on school,"Hi all,

I am considering leaving my job in favor of a post-graduate certificate in a similar, but different field to my current one (starting in May). This field covers a lot of what I enjoy about my current role, and is (from what I have researched) more promising career-wise. This is a 1 year program, and includes a co-op placement. I also already have some experience within this field, since I worked as an intern in university. 

I'm in my mid-20s with no kids, no debt, a supportive partner, and over 100k in savings. As of now, my financial obligations are largely limited to paying rent, bills, etc. My monthly cost of living is approximately $1200 for rent, groceries, other bills, however I have rounded up my spending expectations to $2000 for those 8 months I would be unemployed (in case of unexpected emergencies, ordering food, any misc purchases, etc.)

I've mostly played things very safe up to this point, and have been quite frugal. However, I am feeling very burnt out at my job, and cynical about my career opportunities, as my responsibilities do not cover the experience I would need to find a comparable job in my field.

After that she would just go on standard EI, which would be up to $595 or up to $357. So we'd be going from a bi-weekly gross for her of $2200 to a bi-weekly gross of $714. We don't have a whole lot of savings (just moved in May and used savings for down payment) and obviously a loss of $1586/month is pretty concerning. We usually have a surplus each pay but with the new house also came some renovations which cost more than expected so while we typically have a $8-1000 surplus each pay, it gets eaten up. 

Are there any other government programs/support to look out for? I see the Canada Child Benefit program and a quick calculation of that shows that we would get about $275-300/month.

Investing 500K - suggestions,"2020 was a good year for me finanically. Bought my first home in the GTA with a hefty down payment (480K on a 1.2 Mil mortgage). But I still have nearly 500K sitting on the sides. 

So thinking of putting this to work. I am 33 - so still far off from retirement. Could use some suggestions on how best to leverage this money. 

Particularly around if this is a good time to buy a quality condo vs getting a townhome in the suburbs vs getting another freehold? 

Or go hard in the stock market? 

Or payoff my house further? 

Or wait and see what happens next with Covid? 

On top of this 500K - I have another 250K in RRSP/TFSA and savings for a rainy day. My spouse also has around 100K in reserve savings. So this 500K is basically idling at the moment. Further looks like 2021 will be another lucractive year for me with over 300K in additional savings after tax coming my way.

Living on my own again after becoming a property investor.,"Hi there People of Reddit, 

I mainly lurked, but decided to reach out as my anxiety has been so awful. I'm not even sure if I'm in the correct sub-reddit, as my post will highlight a few different topics. 

Let me provide some context: I'm a single female having moved out for the first time in my late 20’s directly into an apartment style condo late 2019. I’m a fulltime healthcare worker and worked a ton of overtime for years to provide the down payment. But I had a naive and rushed perspective moving into this condo. I had no independent living experience prior to this move, therefore I was unaccustomed to the cons of apartment-style living. Ie: noise, sharing walls with neighbours, property managers, board members, etc. 

That’s another story on it’s own, but basically it was the longest year of my life in which I decided to just convert the property into a rental property earlier this year and move back in with my family. That was a nightmare of a learning curve. Luckily, the tenants that I have don’t seem to have the major issues that I had previously. I assume this may be the case as they did not have the same giant commitment or contribution to the unit as I did, therefore expectations are likely lower (a young newlywed couple with no children). 

Unfortunately, as it is with many children of first-generation immigrant asian parents, moving back in with my family was not all rainbows and sunshine either. Initially, it was a relief to go back to a familiar environment, but the toxic behaviours and interactions that made me want to leave re-surfaced again. Preferably I’d like to have moved again when it is financially feasible to sell my condo, but the state of my mental health was saying otherwise. 

Now I live in a building in a trendy area of my city that came highly recommended by other colleagues that happen to live in the building (it is very close to the hospital I work at). It was all great within the first month, until I started having issues with upstairs neighbours again. Basically the guy was having an illegal gathering on NYE and was making a ton of noise (ie: playing Sweet Caroline acoustic guitar like nobody’s business and repeatedly hopping out of an armchair along the floor with no rug). I had unfortunately work again the following morning and it was already 3am. Having had experience with previous neighbours and feeling morally obligated, I politely approached the guy’s door and let him know I hear them. I did this at the chance that since I’m new the building, he may not have been aware there is someone below him. Instead the guy was a drunk asshole, claiming I’m lying. I’ve gone through the usual channels of informing the landlord and marking some recording evidence. I understand he definitely felt like I was intruding on his personal space, but dude it’s 3am during the time of Covid. I could have called the police instead which I didnt. 

I’m just feeling a ton of anxiety and hopelessness, as I feel like the same issues are re-surfacing. I understand that I may have a level of PTSD from my previous living situation that may be making me more sensitive to otherwise normal experiences of apartment living. And I know that I’m at fault for deciding to live in another apartment building. But the building is a building of professionals compared to my previous condo, which was mainly multi-immigrant families which was a big appeal for me signing on it. I have the ball rolling on selling my condo in hopes that may provide me a better chance at moving into a detached home. Another stressor on top of it all as it is still very early in the mortgage term.

I guess I’m just feeling really overwhelmed with trying to get used to being on my own for real and in an apartment while also working as a fulltime at a hospital during a global pandemic. A lot of my anxiety is feeling very alone in my situation. I don’t know any of my friends, colleagues, or family having gone through my particular experience with regards to owning property that didn’t work out. I know I cannot move back to my parents just because it’s a familiar environment, since I know there are so many reasons for me to finally have my independence so late. I know with time I’ll feel accustomed to this, but I’m finding myself every night before bed trying to read Reddits of how to get used to apartment living while managing being a landlord. 

I’ve tried to re-frame things in my mind in various ways. Such as, so many young people all over the world live in apartments and make it. I have a very intense job that only a small number of the population have experience in, but I feel very calm and comfortable with it more than being in my new home. Or that reminding myself that I’m free of my family’s toxic behaviours and our relationship is finally repairing. I guess I just need reassurance that I’m not crazy, and that things will get better. I cannot break my lease at this point or move to a detached home yet until I sell. I need to find a mindset for me to endure all this and enjoy being on my own. I do al the typical things with regards to noise that I’ve been doing for years, ie; earplugs, white noise, but I’m not finding it as effective. 

Thanks. Hope everyone’s 2021 has been good so far.",20,1609915689.0,2021,2021-01-06,,Lunaziiilla,6,krig8s

mortgage broker giving me uncompetitive rates?,"I need some help, spouse and I are buying our first home and we went with a mortgage broker. We have signed a purchase agreement for a new home but haven't done any paperwork for the mortgage yet. The broker I'm using says she is restricted from several of the big banks. However the rates she has given us are way off the banks (we are looking for a variable, conventional 20% downpayment). 

Just for example, we're getting rates in the 1.85-1.95 range quoted from monoline lenders including the one we have a conditional approval with. I know some banks are offering way better rates like HSBC closer to 1.50 lately. Our broker advised us don't only look at the rates but also the penalties. But from reading some of the penalties from the big banks, it seems like variable rate mortgages are easy to break with 3 months interest penalty. Is this right?

I guess our question is, should we stick with our mortgage broker at this point or try to go with the banks. I know a broker has a fiduciary duty to the client but in this case we just feel like the rate savings is huge and that the reason she is pushing us away from certain big banks is because she doesn't have access.

Capital Gains Taxes with RRSP deduction,"Hoping someone can help verify if I am understanding the capital gains tax calculation correctly when combined with a RRSP contribution.

Lets make the following assumptions:

\- Withdrawl of 900k from a taxable account that qualifies as a capital gain.

\- Assume a personal tax rate of 53.5%

\- Assume $100k in available RRSP contribution room

&#x200B;

So standard tax on this amount would be $900K x 50% (amount taxable under capital gains) x 53.5% =  $240.75K Tax.

Now if we assume a $100K RRSP contribution is the following calcualtion correct:

$900K x 50% = $450K taxable amount 

$450K - $100K RRSP Contribution = $350K updated taxable amount

$350K \* 53.5% = $187.2K tax due.

&#x200B;

When the time comes to do this I will be reviewing this all with a tax accountant and a financial adviser but just want to check if my back of a napkin math is correct as a starting point.

Pay Off Student Loans or Contribute To RRSP (Matched),"Hello,

I'm currently 34, living in Toronto,ON and I make $76,000 a year.

I have $23,000 in student loans at about 3% currently.

I have $0 in retirement savings. I'm currently working on putting together an emergency fund of 3 months expenses, which I should have in about 5 months.

They offer a 20% match on up to 18% of my annual income. I would need to invest about $900/month to max the match.

With my current budget, I save around $1350 /month (30% of my take home pay).

Can I Deduct the Losses Inccured from Paypal's Currency Conversion Fees on my taxes?,"Hey guys,

&#x200B;

18 year old entrepreneur here trying to figure out the confusing world of taxes when it comes to online business & freelancing.

Essentially, I receive USD from US clients. In order to convert that USD to CAD, I must convert it. I know normally, you're supposed to simply use the exchange rate of that day on your taxes, however, Paypal charges a 4% currency conversion fee.

Can I mark that as an expense? Or rather, can I mark their 4% lower conversion rate as the exchange rate on that day? 

&#x200B;

Refinancing rental property,"Hi all,

I have 2 properties, my current residence as well as a rental property, both within NS. I have considerable equity in my rental, so I’d like to refinance, and take the equity to put towards another rental property that has just hit the market.

My broker says that most banks/lenders will not allow me to refinance a rental unit, unless I was to claim it to be owner occupied. 

1) is the inability to refinance rentals true?
2) what are the implications of claiming the home as owner occupied when it’s not?
3) is this common practice?
4) what realistically is my best option to withdraw some equity from the home?

Mortgage refinance worth it?,"Hey financial friends, thanks for any knowledgable advice that you can provide:

I started a 5 year fixed mortgage in Ontario 9 months ago and since then, the interest rate has dropped 1%. In crunching the numbers to determine whether it is worth paying the very large penalty to break the mortgage for the historic low rates, is it enough to compare the Principal remaining at the end of the 5 year term balanced against the money saved in lower monthly payments? In other words, do I need to consider other factors, such as interest paid in the 5 year period, or is that simply what will determine the Principal remaining at the end of the five year term?

personal line of credit,"hello,

I have been looking up on lines of credit and was wondering if it is a good idea to have one? Just for the sake of it, as I don't plan to use it for any one thing specifically, and so personal line of credit came to mind.

For people who have these, are they worth getting into? I have 5 credit cards already, all of which are in great standing and I always pay bills on time and have a good credit score too. One reason the line of credit seems like a good option is due to the lower interest rate and also to have some extra credit available incase of unforseen circumstances.

Any thoughts/input would be greatly appreciated! Cheers",3,1609901912.0,2021,2021-01-05,Credit,jk776,1,krepky
Question regarding 2nd property bought for my parents,"Hi all

I bought a condo for my parents to retire in (they wouldn't qualify for the mortgage and have no assets). I live elsewhere in my Primary Residence. The deed/mortgage of the condo is under my name. The mortgage/condo fees/property taxes are roughly 1000$ all in. The FMV (fair market value) of similar rental properties around is 1100$. My parents will be living in the condo and will be sending me transfers to cover the costs (mortgage/condo fees/property taxes). 

1) Is this considered a rental? 
2) Do i need to declare the income/principal paid when filing my taxes?
3) if yes to above, what if I dont declare the ""income"" and consider the transfers that cover the cost as gifts from parents instead?

Easy Transferable Investment for LIRA/RRSP so it can be transferred to OMERS,"Due to Covid, my shutdown employer (travel Industry) offered severance and commuted value of my DB pension plan in order to reduce their workforce.  I have a small pension at OMERS\* due to short term employment at a different employer who had an OMERS pension plan.  I am therefore eligible to transfer my LIRA and any RRSP accounts to OMERS as long as I have a pension there (I already have RRSPs in my AVC account there).  This wouldn't be their typical pension, but under their Additional Voluntary Contributions funds which is a part of their Primary Pension Plan where I would be able to benefit from their low MERs (around 0.73%) and their professional management of pension funds (5 and 10 year returns have averaged between 8.2 and 8.5%).

I understand I need to direct the LIRA from my commuted value to a LIRA account before transferring to the OMERS plan.  I'm not sure why they won't accept funds directly from my RPP, perhaps the guy I was talking to at OMERS didn't understand it would be coming from an RPP  (I used the words commuted value and not RPP).   Same with RRSP; I have to make an RRSP account before transferring RRSP investments to OMERS.  The way I understand it is they don't want to get involved with substantiating the LIRA or RRSP eligibility before transferring the investment to my account with them.  So I need to create a different account and then transfer it to them after the account has been established as such.

Is OMERS a good place to park my retirement savings over other investments?  I am a conservative investor and like the idea of parking and forgetting about it and I like their investment history.  Any investments with OMERS should be long term and the money isn't accessible except for a short period of the year where you could get access to it if you needed it or wished to transfer out of.  I'm planning on working for another 10 -12 years or more before retiring fully.  The rest of my commuted value will be put into TFFSAs and other unsheltered investments.

What self directed easily transferable investment accounts can I park the LIRA and or RRSP so it can be transferred to the OMERS account quickly and without too many fees?

I guess I'm looking for validation on investing in OMERS as a retirement investment strategy and wondering about getting info on short term accounts to transfer these plans if I go ahead and park my retirement funds at OMERS

Advice Needed: Picking My First Credit Card,"Hi, 

I just turned 18 a couple of months ago and have been looking around for a good first credit card. I have been banking with RBC for about 4 years now and have been working and saving a lot. I have a little more than 15,000$ saved right now and I like to think that I am pretty responsible and smart with my money. 

I received a letter today for a pre-approved Visa Platinum Avion credit card from RBC and they've offered me 20,000 bonus welcome points. While this sounds great, I don't think I need RBC points or any kind of travel miles as I don't think I have a need for them. They've waived the fees for the first year, but the usual fees are 120$, which I don't think is justifiable... I doubt I'll get my money's worth... 

I was thinking about applying to Tangerine's Cash Back Mastercard, I don't meet the minimum income requirement but only by a couple of hundred dollars by my calculations. I think I can get approved? Plus, if I do get approved, I think I'll open a TFSA with Tangerine, so I can take advantage of the 3 categories to get cashback from. 

I am not planning on spending a ton on these credit cards. Around 200$ and probably less per month, no carrying from month to month, just groceries, drug store purchases and gas or public transportation. 

I could also open a TFSA with RBC, but I just don't really see the advantage with RBC? My father seems to think I'm an idiot for considering Tangerine and not wanting the RBC one, he claims I can get more insurance coverage on it, but I think they're pretty similar, and he also claims that the points are very useful but I just don't see how they are? He has that same credit card and says that they waive fees if you ask and you rarely get approved for it so I am really lucky... (I don't like to take financial advice from him, by the way, he is drowning in a LOT of credit card debt)...

What is my best course of action? Should I try getting both? If you have these, what are the pros & cons? Thanks so much!",9,1609889081.0,2021,2021-01-05,Credit,cyberlover2,3,krank7

My Dad has been locked out of his CRA account. He's been on-hold with them for two days trying to get a hold of someone to help him get access to his account back. Today he finally got through to someone, who asked for information like his SIN, address, recent taxes ect.

After he gave her all the information she said she could not help him because the information was either incorrect or insubstantial. When he asked her what information was wrong, she refused to tell him, and when she asked what other information she could use she told him to taxes from 2010-2015 would work. Like I assume most Canadians, my Dad doesn't keep such old tax records on hand so he asked her to stay on hold while he gets it and she said waiting for information is against their policy.

Finally, my Dad asked to be transferred to someone in charge or even someone else who could help. She also said that's against their policy. Ultimately my Dad did not get his CRA back. He's an old man, who speaks two languages before English. He probably got locked out because he spelt his Email wrong one time too many; nothing malicious.

Is there anything he can do now to try to regain his CRA?",17,1609887392.0,2021,2021-01-05,Taxes,,0,kra2mn
"At what point can you go from saving to living your ""perfect life""?","I know the ""perfect life"" thing is maybe not the best working, but whatever. You will understand in the post.

Basically, I always heard that the best way to be financially successfull, buy what you want, etc. is to live below your means. So, live in small appartements, do not go out to eat, don't go with the most expensive brand, etc. 

This is all to gather more money to be able to ""go big"" later in life. (else, why the hell would I save my money if it's not to spend it. If I am dead and I didn't use my money, what's the point?) So, I save my money ""for later"". When is ""later""? When/how can I determine: ""this is THE moment to start living like I always wanted"". I know, like you must save money for retirement, but I can't believe that I will live below my means all my life to only get crazy when I am the closest to death...

For example, my ""dream lifestyle"" that is still quite reasonable is to live in an appartement in Montreal. I am currently on the South Shore and I am in love with this city. Waking up every building with a beautiful view on the city just seems delightful. However, obviously, these apartements are quite expensive (like 2k$ to 5k$/month) or something like a 1-2 millions dollar appartement. Like, I know it may sound crazy but, hey, I can dream haha.

So, anyway: when do I know I am ready to drop 2k$/month on housing, how much money do I need saved, how much money do I need invested. What is the calculation to do before starting to live more than saving money.",8,1609887311.0,2021,2021-01-05,,AsteroidSnowsuit,0,kra1o8

Is it true that you can't get credit card application approved while on Employment Insurance? Advice please on increasing credit limit?,"I just got off the phone with an RBC agent and he told me that specifically,

'You **cannot** do a new credit card application while on EI. I have to be back at work to be able to get a credit card application. And the pre-approval for a credit card increase got denied' (3rd time in a row every 6 months).

Is this true? I mean unemployed and students get cc's approved daily. I've been pretty fucking frustrated by my $500 credit limit. I only have 3k in debt from 12k in july (NSLSC) not to be paid till april I have an extra 5k in cash/assets. Also I have a 720 credit score.

I pay zero in rent/overhead as i live with family. It's a frustrating cycle because if its $500, i can only spend $100 since you would want to keep utilization at 20%. Then at 20% I can never get my score to move up, because apparently 'im not spending enough'. But if I spend too much then I'm getting fucked by utilization limit. See the circle?

Provided I work hard and stay on this career path, I can expect to hit 100-150k in my career.

I've seen two schools of thought on this sub: a) fill up the contribution room now so that you can have it invested for longer and b) wait until you're earning morning so that you can avoid higher tax rates.

Took a Professional Development Leave Before the Pandemic and Now I'm Looking at a Financial Rut.,"Hi everyone. I’m looking for any general advice for my particular financial situation.  I'll try to keep this in point form for everyone's sake, but will be happy to add details where needed.

Through a program at my work I took a professional development leave starting in August 2020 and ending in May 2021 in order to complete a master’s program. 

* This PD leave was arranged well before the pandemic. 
* During this leave I am earning 55% of what I usually earn and my employer will pay for half of my tuition (I fill out an expense report and I’m reimbursed directly to my bank account). 
* Before the pandemic my initial idea was to move back home while studying and to either rent or Airbnb my condo. The pandemic has complicated this as rental prices dropped and it has become difficult to find short-term tenants. Also my building has temporarily restricted AirBNB. 
* I’m still doing okay financially but I am constantly eating away at my savings and it will be very tight to make it to the end of my PD term without wiping out my savings completely.  This of course is worrying as it doesn’t leave a lot of room to account for emergencies. 
* I know I do have the option of renting out my condo at a low cost, but worry about the issues this may arise for such a short term rental and I definitely do not want to try to Airbnb without my building’s consent. 
* My master’s program is an online program does not qualify for OSAP (Ontario Student Assistance Program).

I was wondering if anyone had any advice or insight as to what government assistant programs or options may be made available to me. I worry about seeking loans or any government-related assistance that would require repayment. Aside from a mortgage, I'm debt free but wouldn't want to accumulate any debt.  

I have not applied for any government relief during the pandemic as I didn’t feel my situation necessarily qualifies as COVID related.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!",4,1609883632.0,2021,2021-01-05,Budget,jdp11,0,kr8t7i

Financial Advice for a couple in 20s making 130k (Fresh Graduates in ON),"Thanks for reading my post. I got lots of helpful information from this page.  
Happy new year to you all.

We are married couple in 20s (London, ON), making around 130k before tax.  
\- \[**Savings**\] TFSA: 90k + Cash: 10k  
\- \[**Tuition Credits**\] Federal: 150k combined, Provincial (ON): 100k combined  
\- \[**Student Debt**\] Federal: 10k, Provincial (ON): 4k | grace period ends at the end of this June  
\- \[**2020 Income**\] Less than lowest tax brackets (each 20\~30k). We started working in 2020 Fall.  
\- \[**TFSA Room 2021\]** 10k + 10k

Our plan for this year is:  
\- Making **maximum TFSA contribution**  
**-** Making **maximum RRSP contributions**  
\- **Using all tuition credits this year**  
\- **Paying off** the **student loan** in **2 years**  
\- **Purchase a house (\~550k?)**  
\- **Get a mortgage from mortgage broker for the house purchase**

If you guys have any advice on if this plan seems intelligent at our current financial situation, I would really appreciate them.

Some of big questions:  
1. Is it wise to empty out the TFSA for making down-payment of 20%? or should we keep the TFSA?  
2. I think fixed rate from mortgage brokers (Ex. lowestrates, homewise, ..) for 5 years will be a good option at this time. What's your opinions on it? or any suggestions on the mortgage brokers/websites?  
3. How much down-payment would be appropriate?  
4. Is it possible to get the tax benefits of RRSP contribution (18%), made prior to the down-payment and withdraw them all for the down-payment?

Young female mid 20's- universal life insurance?,"Hi everyone, 
I have joined this subreddit in 2020 with attempts to learn things about saving/investing/ etc. I have learned so much from this subreddit so thank you.

Paid-up whole life permanent insurance with dividends""** as a tool for a pension, overall investment, and of course, life insurance. With my age, I will finish paying my premium at 43, with a $100,000 base coverage. Is this a decent idea? Aiming to use for investing/paying off things. Is there an option to cash out/would I want to?

24 Year Old Looking for Advice; Investing Vs Rent Vs Buy,"Hi Everyone, long time lurker of this sub and grateful for the advice everyone has shared to begin investing early and budgeting to plan for the future.

This is not a brag post but genuinely looking for advice from others helping with  the ""personal"" part of personal finance and wondering how others would approach my situation. 

I've made 24 trips around the sun - 25 in May, I come from a family that wasn't particularly well off and very conservative with spending / budgeting, which has in a way helped me build budgeting and investing habits early. I live at home in the GTA which has allowed me to save money to this point. I have been working since I was 16 years old with regular scheduled shifts, and graduated university with no student debt between working part time and internships.  I worked hard to find an internship that turned into a job at a great Tech company in Toronto. This year I will be making close to (or above) 100K with salary and variable (80k  base Salary). 

I have approx 40K in TFSA and 17.5K in RRSP to date,  invested mainly in XEQT & VOO as well as a few fun picks for stocks making up a small % of my portfolio. I have 100k in a Tangerine HISA that I have been building as a emergency fund and potential down payment for a property (GTA). 

I feel I have reached a point where I feel I need to do something, as keeping this money in a HISA is very inefficient

1. due to current interest rates
2. due to rising housing prices in the GTA
3. Potential return on ETFs

I am unsure if I am ready to purchase a property (or one I'd be happy in) and also feel that this may be better saved for when me and my girlfriend (which will be working as a nurse in a less than a year) eventually look to get engaged / married and move in together, which would likely be in a few years from now if everything works out. 

I generally do not prefer the idea of a condo due to risk of bad management companies, special assessments, and I value space that is bigger than 500 / 600 sqft which seems to be in line with my individual affordability. I also recognize the importance of building equity and putting my money to work, and for this reason would prefer not to rent but may end up exploring this route to gain more experience living on my own.

I also come from a house where being told to rent is a sinful waste of money (I know this is BS), but I understand the idea of this compared to building equity in a home. While at home life isn't bad, I feel I need to find a better balance of privacy, and my own room to grow, especially in a working from home / pandemic environment. 

A few options I have drawn up include: 

* Look for a condo where I can put 20% down and mortgage + condo fees that work out to be similar to cost of rent  (assume$1800 or lower)
* Rent for a short / medium term,  while figuring out career / relationship / living as an adult , top up registered accounts, and continue keeping emergency fund & down payment for future
* Continue living at home for the interim (1-2 years) and focus on building my investment portfolio, churn bank accounts with highest HISA for down payment 

I Would love to hear other suggestions or general advice, for how to plan for the next few years. I don't want to make an irrational decision and get caught up in housing market FOMO and end up in a small condo I will not be happy with in the next 5-10 years, but at the same time I recognize I am fortunate to have the option for home ownership for now.

Did I screw myself out of TFSA contribution room by doing this?,"This year was the first time I had ever contributed to a TFSA. I turned 18 in 2012, so I had a ton of room that had accumulated over the years.


I started by opening a TFSA with Questrade, deposited $5k, but changed my mind & withdrew (never invested). 

Then I put around $10k into WealthSimple, invested, but transferred my portfolio 'in-kind' to Questrade after seeing WealthSimple lacked stocks I became interested in + no webpage/desktop option at the time. 


From there, I made an InteractiveBrokers TFSA, deposited $5k, but quickly withdrew after changing my mind, and settled on using Questrade... and ended up contributing a grand total of about $40-55k to the Questrade TFSA.

Those investments with my Questrade TFSA made me profit and a few months later I sold most of the shares (approx $35k worth), withdrew to my checking account to invest in different stocks with RBC, however, I'll be transferring most of that BACK to Questrade after learning RBC DI can't support the type of trade I wanted to place.

HELOC Mortgage vs Personal LoC,"Hi PFCers,

I have no outstanding debts besides a small student loan and a decent emergency fund saved. The popular advice on here is to obtain a LoC before you actually need one. Spoke to the credit advisor at my bank who informed me that based on my debt levels and income I can apply for the maximum of 50K. Of course what I actually qualify for at what interest rate will depend on my credit rating among other factors.

He then said, if I'm not planning to apply for a mortgage in the next 3 months then doing a credit check will not be a problem.

This got me thinking that instead of applying for a personal LoC, I should apply for a HELOC mortgage and suggest to my parents to add/sell me a part of their house. They could then use the additional money to do renovations/invest/etc while using a low-interest source of funds.

I'm sure my thought process has lots of things that need consideration, but that's why I've posted here to the experts. Is something like this even possible, what are the reasons I shouldn't try to do this? Location Ontario.",5,1609878286.0,2021,2021-01-05,,supersuckysucculent,0,kr6wjc
Moving savings from TFSA to HISA,"I'm hoping to buy a house in the Spring/Summer of this year. I have $18k sitting in a TFSA with Wealthsimple, with a return of .1%.

I currently bank with Simplii and they have a 2% interest promo on their HISA until March 31st.  Does it make sense for me to withdraw the $18k from the WS TFSA and move it into my Simplii HISA to collect that interest?

Mortgage pre-approval question,"Hi. 

So my fiancee are hoping to buy a house sometime this year. We have $20000 saved for a down-payment. We are about to approach our bank to discuss mortgage pre-approval so we can get an idea of what we can afford.
But before we do we're curious how it will work with her currently being here on a student visa with 1 more semester to go from jan- April. She has been here in Canada for 5 years now on a student visa. We plan on getting married within the next 3 months and will have an exact date soon as it will just be small/eloping.

Now with her not being a permanent resident yet but with the plan of me sponsoring her as soon as we're married I'm curious how we should go about the mortgage process. I obviously want her involved in the process as it will be our mortgage for the foreseeable future but I do not know how the bank will do things since I don't think she is allowed to be on the mortgage if she doesn't have permanent residency and her finances or credit score may not be applicable because of that?

Condo Fees vs. Home Maintenance: Preference and/or considerations?,"Just going to preface that I have read articles on this already prior to posting. However, I like the advice on this sub and you can’t go wrong with somewhat tailored advice compared to an article.

So to keep it simple:
Will be pulling the trigger on my first property this year or early 2022. I’m in Ottawa

Pros for a condo are obviously location (downtown lifestyle post Covid), and lots of convenience for pretty much anything. Biggest drawback is no roommate rent, no option for 2nd car, and I have no idea how expensive condo fees are supposed to be.

Pros for a townhome would be space, room for 2-3 cars, some roommate rent before I settle down, and space. Drawbacks are commute, maintaining a home myself and a higher mortgage (will need private mortgage insurance too).

None of the pros/cons are deal breakers, I really don’t care that much. I am very uneducated however on house maintaining costs vs condo fees, and would love practical advice from you guys. 

TLDR it’s condo with fees but no PMI or a house with rental potential but PMI and larger mortgage.

Help navigating wisdom tooth payments?,"I hope this is the right sub for an inquiry like this. My apologies if not, and please redirect me accordingly.

I'm 25 years old living in Edmonton, and am going to need my wisdom teeth out soon. I received a quote from  my dentist, and the procedure will cost more than I have in my bank account (I'm on student loans with minimal savings). The university will cover \~$200 of the procedure (possibly up to $750 if I work with them further, but even that would hardly make a dent in the cost). I don't have any private insurance, nor do my parents. The only coverage I have access to is the university.

I'm wondering if anybody has any experience with this, and might have any ideas or suggestions (i.e. if it's possible to look around for other dentists who might have payment plans/how to do that, prolonging the procedure, different approaches, etc.)?

I'm also still technically a resident of BC (lived there my whole life, moved to Edmonton \~6 months ago) and so I believe if I were to wait until the teeth were bad enough that I needed to be hospitalized to have them removed, MSP might cover it...?

What would happen if all credit accounts for one person are closed?,"So some things have come to light with my husband and without getting into much detail it’s been discovered that he was hiding a significant amount of debt from me. He’d been making minimum payments so his credit score is decent but it spiralled and this isn’t the first time this has happened. 

We have discussed it and will be seeking counselling (both together and him separately) to try to resolve this but have decided that for the time being I will be managing all our money. 

Essentially, he can’t be trusted to have any credit cards at the moment, but I also don’t want to destroy his credit score. What would happen if we were to close all his credit cards? 

Note that his debt has been moved into my low interest LOC and we used a good chunk of our savings to pay off the majority. So he currently has no balances on his cards. 

If closing them wouldn’t be a good idea, what can we do? Maybe request new cards so that the account numbers are different and I keep them so he cannot use them?

I have a TFSA opened through Wealthsimple Trade. I still have plenty of room for contributions but I was wondering about how buying/selling stocks vs withdrawals affect your contribution limit.

Property taxes TFSA(Quebec province),"Hi everybody,

Let me know if it doesn't make sense or isn't appropriate to ask here.

I own 2 properties and have around 8000$ property taxes that are paid twice annually(march 4000$ and june another 4000$) in QUÉBEC Province.

I wanted to invest that amount in a TFSA every year and sell the equities inside whenever I need to pay my taxes. I wouldn't mind ""losing"" that contribution for that year since I would retake it next year anyways. My TFSA is far from maxed out (20k$) so it wouldn't be a problem.

The risk aspect is also not ""a problem"" I would invest in something that has less risk. I was thinking about something like XEQT or XUU that would potentially bring back ~10% annually. I didn't want to invest in a HISA TFSA as it only brings around 1%. I have a HELOC at like 3% so I wouldn't mind if my investment loses value as it will eventually go up.

Does anyone use this technique? If yes, would XEQT or XUU be alright for TFSA in that situation? or you'd go with something safer?",4,1609862897.0,2021,2021-01-05,Estate,tankybam84,0,kr1bvo

Looking for a little advice on savings account,"Hey Gang , looking for a little advice before I got to step 2. ( talking to someone) In the past I’ve talked to the Royal bank ( where my account is ) and they basically attacked me like they needed every dime I make to start a retirement fund . I walked out and never called them back although I keep my account there since I’ve had it since I been 9.  Talking to family members and friends , seems everyone is right but everyone has different advice and it confuses me.  . Gets to borderline arguments on who’s right . Ive painted a couple investment firms like E.Jones and picked their brains when I can , but it just seems everyplace wants to lock you in til your 70 or something. So, my situation is I’m 50 years old , mortgage and debt free , self employed ( painter) and I have roughly 100K in the plane jane savings account . No inheritances coming so I need to do something wise over the next years . Hope this question is ok to ask on this sub . Thanks .",13,1609859919.0,2021,2021-01-05,,Leeboy20,1,kr0cm7
Whole Life Insurance - Manulife Performax Gold,"Unfortunately my parents got suckered into buying whole life insurance in their 50s specifically manulife performax gold. They are paying $11k a year in premiums for 15 years then none after for a $250k eventual pay out. They have already been paying for 5 years so the sunk costs are too high to get out. Not going to get into how bad an investment it is but I'm trying to figure out what the cash value can be used for as the contract they were given is not all that clear.

I did some googling and it seems the cash value is not actually that useful what's so ever. My understanding is that they can take out a loan against the accumulated cash value but they will be charged interest and it would also reduce the payout so i really don't see the point. They can also withdraw from the cash account but again it reduces the payout and they would be taxed on the withdrawals. Can they use the accumulated cash value to pay towards the annual premiums or lump the amount together with the payout? There's also this performance credits thing manulife gives every year but my parents opted to use it to further their cash value in an accumulation account. Again, i'm concerned that this is going to waste as i really dont see the point of the cash account at all. I tried asking my parents to ask the insurance agent but they are too embarrassed so I'm reaching out here.

Does anyone have experience with how the cash value works for Manulife Performax Gold specifically and can help chip in?

Much appreciated.",1,1609859379.0,2021,2021-01-05,Insurance,ClosetPervy,1,kr06hc

Foreigner holding DRS shares in Canada,"Dear all,

I have a bit of quandary, and I've tried searching through the reddit to see if this has come up, but it doesn't seem so.

I've received some shares in a Computershare DRS as compensation - but I am not a resident of Canada nor a Canadian citizen. I've been working with my bank to try and see if we can transfer the shares to my local share account in Europe,but this also seems difficult.

I would rather hold on to the shares for a while, but selling via Computershare is wildly expensive.

Is it possible for foreigners to open an account with a Canadian brokerage? I've contacted Questrade but they have not replied as yet.

Has anyone managed to transfer shares from Canada to European share accounts?

Why is there a term on TFSA account since I can withdraw whenever I want ?,"Hi !

This is a noob question as I am starting with investing.

I went on my bank website to open a TFSA account, and it lets me pick different plans, with terms that vary between 3 to 6 years.

I don't understand what the term is for ? I would imagine it is the time before I can withdraw money, but I understand that you can withdraw from a TFSA whenever you want.

I also understand that money withdrawn from the account still counts toward your limit.

finance tips for an 18 year old university student,"The title says it all but here are some in depth details about my situation and my goals.

I have $0 to start off with and I currently have $10,000 in OSAP debt. I am planning to get a summer job so I can earn some extra cash. The good news I am currently in is that my parents can pay for my cost of living so I do not need to stress about that. The part where I am still thinking on how to manage my earned money is by putting 40% of my paycheque towards my paying back my OSAP Loans, 40% towards building an emergency fund and 20% of spending income (eating out, going out, clothes, etc.). For my goal, I am hoping that by the time I graduate, I can pay off my student debt upfront and have some degree of cash in my wallet so I can take my time to find actual work. Now, the part where I want to ask finance tips from you guys is should I just spend 80% of my earned paycheque towards paying back my OSAP Loans or should I keep my management plan as is?

Note: I am currently a first year student and I am planning to pay back my OSAP loan right after I graduate. That 40% of my paycheque would not leave my wallet until I graduate.

Need suggestions for RRSP contribution in January and Feb for 2021,"Hi, 

A quick background. I became PR in Canada and got a job in BC in 2019.  For the year 2020, my RRSP contribution limit was approx. 15K which I have already used by opening a  basic RRSP savings account. 

My wife became PR in 2020 and landed a job in the second half of  2020. I think her RRSP contribution limit for 2021 will be approx. 5K

In 2021, we are planning to purchase a home and thus wanted to use the Home Buyers Plan for tax benefits.  I am sure with my 2021 RRSP limit will be higher than 15K. 

My understanding was that the RRSP contribution cycle usually goes from March to February and anything contributed in January and February is considered for the previous year. 

In order to max out my RRSP withdrawal limit of 35K for home purchase and complete the 90-day lock-in period, 

&#x200B;

1. Can I start contributing to my RRSP now in January and February for the year 2021 before I get Notice of Assessment ( at least 15K to be safe not to breach the limit until I know for 2020 tax NOA)?

2.   Can my wife open the RRSP account now and deposit 5K in the RRSP savings account before her first tax filing in Canada happens and she gets her 2020 Notice of Assessment? 

3. If the answer to the first 2 questions is Yes, how do we contribute now and mark these contributions for 2021 and not for 2020?

"""Inflation Truthers"" — Ben Carlson","From the author who gave us Bob, the world’s worst market timer:

* https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/02/worlds-worst-market-timer/

Is an article on inflation:

> Every time I write about the current inflation rate or the possibility of higher inflation in the future, invariably a handful of people will comment about how high inflation is already here.

[…]

> Asset price inflation is not a thing. Risk assets generally go up over the long-term. The same is true of most real estate. In fact, that’s one of the biggest reasons to invest over the long-term — to beat inflation and keep up with or improve your standard of living.
>
> Second of all, anecdotal price increases do not mean government statistics are somehow masking the true nature of inflation.
> 
> This is simply a case of the availability bias, where people assume things that easily come to mind are more representative of the truth than they actually are.

[…]

> But if we take away the outlier 2020 data points, the average real annual GDP growth from 2010-2019 was 2.3%. The inflation rate in that time averaged roughly 1.8% per year.
> 
> If you’re one of the conspiracy people who believe inflation has actually been running at 5-6% per year, that would assume the economy has been contracting by 1-3% per year over the past 10 years.
> 
> And if you’re a full tinfoil hat person who assumes inflation is actually 10-12% per year[fn2], that’s like saying we’ve been in a full-blown depression and the economy has lost 80% of its value.
> 
> This is absurd and patently false but that’s the claim you’re making if you really think inflation is this high.

[…]

> Of course, there are areas of the country where housing prices are out of control. But this is how averages work. Some data points are above average while others are below average.
> 
> The same is true of the inflation rate.
>
> There are certainly households that feel the sting of rising prices more than others. And there are those households where people don’t realize how much their standard of living has improved over time because we become accustomed to the deflationary forces of technology.
> 
> The government isn’t suppressing the “actual” inflation number. And if they were, they would also be suppressing reported economic growth which is something no politician in their right mind would ever do.

[…]

> [fn2] There are actually [people](https://twitter.com/tanayj/status/1345080274107785216?s=20) who believe this. [Link to tweet on Chapwood Index, which was [discussed on PFC recently](https://old.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/kprrnj/).]

So if the GDP grew ""only"" ~2.5% (in the US), then any inflation above that (as the 'truthers' claim), would mean we were actually in a recession/depression for the last decade... which makes no sense. If inflation is >5% (per the truthers), then the economic growth would have had to been on top of that, for a nominal growth rate of >7%.",133,1609849613.0,2021,2021-01-05,Misc,throw0101a,42,kqxj4m
Suggestion needed as a 21 year old student,"Hi,

&#x200B;

I am currently in second year with 12k student loan debt and 3k in savings. Since I'm living with my parents (and I don't have a job), I want to invest this money rather than letting them sit collecting dust in a low-interest savings account. So rather than spending all 3k into investing, I want to get my feet wet first by investing in funds/stock market. I've read about having an emergency fund is important in case of a market crash (or whatever happens), so I want to invest 1.3k and leaving me with 1.7k to survive (or emergency fund). 

&#x200B;

I know there is/was a global market crash due to COVID/Oil war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, so it seems logical to me to start investing some of this unused money now since the market is down. 

&#x200B;

So after watching some youtube videos, my current idea is to use **QUESTRADE** to invest in stocks and/or ETFs due to their lower fees compared to other brokerages (ie. versus RBC direct investing). As an adult who doesn't have any experience with investing (or anything related to money generally), I'm currently taking McGill's online financial essential course to improve my overall financial literacy.

My current goal is to pay off my student loan as soon as I graduate, I presume by the time I graduate (2023), my student loan will grow to  \~30k. 

 I have few questions that I want to ask;

&#x200B;

1. Is **there any EASY to read books that can help me improve my financial/investing literacy in general?**

It's hard for me who just grown out of my teenage years who lacks experience with the real world when most new stuff is intimidating such as personal finance and investing. So I want to have a solid foundation of financial literacy before I go into it further, but at the same time, I can't understand anything that is too in-depth/ too many words (like a 20 page essay on what ETF is). Any recommended books, articles, websites that I can take a look at?

2. **What do you guys think about investing in energy stocks/ETFs?**

Due to the pandemic, a lot of natural resources stocks had gone down. I presume after the pandemic is over, these energy stocks will go back up again due to demands for natural resources such as oil and gas will increase. I'm thinking about investing in Imperial Oil and Enbridge, so by the time I graduate within the next 2-3 years, I think the pandemic will be over and the prices will go up and cover a portion of my student loan.

&#x200B;

Any energy ETF/stock recommendations that I should look into?

&#x200B;

3. **Is Questrade a good platform for a young person like me?**

I heard it's one of the lowest fees and fairly easy to use. I want to open a TFSA account with Questrade to start investing. Any feedbacks?

&#x200B;

**4. What do you guys think about investing in other stocks/ETFs related to the GAMING industry and Car industry? Or any other industry that I should take a look at?**

It does seem to me that the gaming industry had just been booming for the past decade, I suspect it would grow even bigger within the next 10 years. 

  As for the car industry, it seems like the car market is recovering from the market crashes so it seems like I would be able to make a profit for the next 2-3 years just as I can cash out to pay for my student loan. 

&#x200B;

Overall, I know 1.3k is just a really small amount, but at least it would get me started in investing and personal finance. So I want people with more real-life experience to comment and to give suggestions/recommendations on my current situation. Any comment is appreciated.

&#x200B;

my groceries are expensive because i require specialized food for my conditions, soon i will be moving out and won’t have aid from parents. I’ll have rent, bills, car, and other bills that come up after you move out. due to my illnesses it’s impossible for me to work while in school, because of the extreme fatigue and physical and mental exhaustion. without a job, can i qualify for living expenses as well?

"Educating myself about finance, need some help","Hello PFC,


I (late 20s M, BC) have been trying to educate myself about finance over the holiday. I realized that I know nothing about finance and just wasting money on small stuff. The post is a bit long, so bear with me.

&nbsp;

I used [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/8c7gn1) to see my spending. For income, I've just saving money in a chequing account, not even a saving acct. I know this is terrible that I am actually losing money to inflation. I don't even have that much. I want to be better at my personal finance. My parents don't know much and I don't talk to my friends about finance. I am trying to educate myself over internet.

### overall

**Things I want to cut down**

* phone plan. not using any data while staying home. I am thinking changing to public mobile.
* internet plan. I think i pay way too much for a single person.
* car insurance. opt out some premium. I don't commute anymore

**Things I want to do**

* move the emergency fund to a HISA. I am thinking EQ's HISA (1.5%). TD doesn't seem to have a good HISA.
* get a CC with better cash back rate. TD infinite one is the one I am thinking (already bank with TD)

**questions**

### investment

I've been reading the canadian couch potato. I think I will start putting some money into investing ETF with CCP's model. I would like to open WealthSimple trade to do the DIY approach. Then when I am comfortable, use questrade for US stocks.

**questions**

* Is there a way I can see WealthSimple's list vs Questrade's list? I know WS has less, but how can I check without creating an account first.
* For ETF on TSX with us companies, how does dividend get paid out? Do I get it in USD or CAD? If it's in USD, I know TFSA will need to pay the 15% US withholding tax. And RRSP doesn't.

Is there anything I can do better or anything I should know? Any help/feedback is appreciated.",7,1609823172.0,2021,2021-01-05,Investing,blaze_kid,8,kqr5q5
Can an employer benefit from CEWS while simultaneously reduce the salary on their employees?,"I was recently made aware of the CEWS Registry and saw that my employer is on it.

Very early with the pandemic we were essentially *forced* to accept a significant reduction of salary (or else) while keeping our working hours the same.

I recently listened to a tv show in Québec that talk about finance and they were talking about some covid wage subsidy were meant to keep the employees salary the same admit reduction of working hours due to the pandemic. I don't know which program they were talking about, I only heard part of the interview.

So my question is if it's legal to receive the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) or the equivalent program in Québec while simultaneously keeping your employees at the same working hours and reducing their salary?",5,1609822765.0,2021,2021-01-04,Employment,Kraigius,1,kqr1bu
Paid off $50k in Student Loans in less than 2 years without leaving University,"Just wanted to make a post to celebrate having paid off my entire student debt in less than 2 years from income generated purely from academic sources. 

From the ages of 18-24, I did an undergrad and an unfunded masters back to back, accumulating $50k in student loans over those 6 years, when I finished my Master's I had just $2000 in cash on hand. 

I jumped straight into a fully-funded PhD program in Sept. 2019, today I am 1.5 years in. Between my faculty scholarship, a merit-based grant, and by working triple the recommended workload for Teaching Assistants (450 hours in 2019-2020, don't tell my union rep) I'm very happy to brag that today, at 25 years old and without ever holding a 'real job' I've saved the $50k in cash that I need to pay off my debts in full. 

I'm not *actually* going to pay it off so long as it retains interest-free status. Until then, I've got $40k parked in my TFSA and holding onto a $10k cash safety net. I've already seen $2k in returns from my TFSA in the time that it's been invested, free money baby. The day I graduate (or drop out, equally likely) I'll be able to clear it at once and I won't have paid a cent in interest, as I've never not been a student since starting the loan. 

At the rate that I'm saving I should hit my contribution limit ($60.5k) later this year. I almost can't believe it myself. I remember thinking to myself that it would be neat if I could save enough to zero my student loans in the time that I'm a PhD student but never expected that to happen so quickly. 

Question for PFC, what should I be doing with my savings once I exceed my TFSA limit? Just buy VGRO?",20,1609822615.0,2021,2021-01-04,Debt,Superduperbals,54,kqqzwf
Can anyone help me better understand wealthsimple tfsa/personal investing?,"Hi so im pretty new to investing but im hoping to do some long term investing as I have funds saved up from working during the pandemic.

So first i have tfsa account at CIBC investing in mutual funds. 

Now i want to invest elsewhere as I thought it might grow faster through wealthsimple but am wondering what the tax rule (if any) there is in openning multiple tfsa accounts. So if i open a tfsa invest account on wealthsimple is that ok? As long as im within my cobtribution limit? 
Should i instead open a personal account and report any growth as capital gains? Do you report capital gains only after you withdraw money?

Lets say im investing 100 today, should i invest that into a personal account or tfsa account on wealthsimple? Or an rrsp? Do you max out the tfsa before you max out your rrsp?

Based on some quick research, Tangerine offers a US dollar savings account with unlimited free transactions, no minimum balance and 0.10% interest rate.

Is this a valid tax strategy given the circumstances?,"I will be doing taxes for my mom [61F] who lost her retail job in March 2020.

Her 2020 income will be 5k in employment income earned from January to March and the rest will be CERB and CRB of about $21k (she qualified for maximum benefits).

She paid virtually no taxes aside from a small withholding tax on her pay stub and about 700 in total deducted form CRB so could be looking at a hefty tax bill (given her circumstances).

She is looking for word but realistically will likely not work until May / April at the earliest and even then it is not clear what job she will get or how long many hours she’ll get as she used to work part time (very safe to say she will likely not earn more than $5k from employment this year).

She has saved most of the money she earned this year, so I’m thinking the best tax plan would be to contribute a large chunk to her RRSP (around $8k) and withdraw it later this year, potentially immediately if necessary (withholding taxes are around 10% which will likely be returned when 2021 taxes are filed).

My questions:

1. Can I do this and is this legal?

2. What type of income is CERB/CRB treated as and are there any other deductions such as CPP or EI to consider?

3. Are there more effective means to reduce the tax bill?",7,1609819960.0,2021,2021-01-04,Taxes,TaxQQQ,1,kqq8zx

Calculating RESP returns based on age of child,"I've been trying to calculate the optimum returns for an RESP (Registered Education Savings Plan).  There are two aspects I'm trying to optimize for, first is guaranteed (government grant) returns and second is investment growth.

There are a lot of rules to getting the CESG (Canada education savings grant) around contributing every year and its unclear how much you'll get depending on when you start.  The grants stop after the child reaches the age of 17. There's only $7,200 available in grants and at higher income levels you'll need to put in $2,500 minimum yearly.

So I created a spreadsheet to examine how it plays out and how best to contribute money. The spreadsheet uses the last strategy below, putting in a larger sum initially.  It calculates based of the current age of the child what that large sum is and what total grant money is possible.  For example starting with a 7 year old you can only get $5,500 worth of grants because the grants stop by the age of 17.

EDIT: I'm updating the spreadsheet based on conversation in the comments around carry forward room.  Will update post when formulas work out.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BifAWKja8PihXfoleZoSVdjIcphdOTF63OHbDtulQ3s/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BifAWKja8PihXfoleZoSVdjIcphdOTF63OHbDtulQ3s/edit#gid=0) (you'll need to make a copy to edit and try it for yourself)

**Strategies I've seen**

**All in on growth**. If you have the money and wanted to purely optimize for investment value I think the simple recommendation is to drop $50k (the maximum amount) into an RESP right now. You'll receive the max yearly contribution grant from the government of $500 and that's it but you'll likely outpace all other strategies given timing and a bull market.

**Only the grant**. If you're only interested in the government grant you could drop $35,000 over 14  years ($2,500 / year) to all get all the grants applied yearly. With this option you could take the other $15,000 remaining in of the $50,000 limit and invest it otherwise.  Which takes us to my next strategy.

**Seed money, optimize grant**. This is my current strategy. Take the above one but put the $15k (or more) in first. I want to optimize for growth while also putting in the required amounts yearly to gain the grants for some guaranteed returns. This doesn't have the same likely returns as the All in plan but it does mean that in a bear market I'll still have $7,200 (max grants) in returns coming while at the same time I'm putting in as much up front to make the investment as large as possible.

NOTE: I didn't plan for grants under the $97k income threshold because I make more than that and its more complicated.

I'd appreciate any other views on this. Also beware my spreadsheet functions which are prone to error. Happy to fix up any mistakes. Thanks!",15,1609818970.0,2021,2021-01-04,Investing,clarkbw,6,kqpybj

Home Buying Advice,"My partner and I have been renting for the past 3 years and are looking to buy a home in the near future. I was hoping to get a second opinion on the situation. We live in a reasonably low cost of living city where we can buy a fairly nice home for $500k. We are thinking of buying in the $500-$600k range. 

Our stats:

* 25 and 26 years old
* $160k combined income
* $45k in TFSA
* $12k in savings
* Partner has \~$10k in RRSP and I have a DB plan (can't access for first time home buyer)
* $500/month on our shared vehicle with \~$25k remaining balance, car is worth about this if not slightly more
* $7k remaining on student loan

We're currently renting for $1,700/month and our lease ends at the end of May at which point we were hoping to be moving into a new home. I figure that we can put $50k down on a $500k home at which point the mortgage would be \~$2,000/month which I think is more than doable given our situation. I am also considering renting for another year, which should allow us to save an additional $40k or so, provided bonuses are solid in 2021 for the both of us.

"Behold, the credit card transaction that took 5 months to post","Today I got a very strange email from PC Financial notifying me that a transaction from August 7 had posted to my account. Naturally, I was quite confused as to how a transaction would take 5 months to post.

Here's what happened. As you may know, Amazon doesn't charge your card until the product ships. I placed an order in late July, but it didn't have stock, so it wouldn't ship until August 7th. However, in early August, my card was stolen so I had to get a replacement. I guess when Amazon tried to charge the card, it was caught in some kind of limbo. It wasn't until the year-end audit that PC Financial caught the transaction in limbo and finally shuttled it through.

Mobile Contracts in Canada became way worse in last year?,"Me and my wife, we both having Rogers likes from SK, with 5GB data, unlimited Canada wide everything else.

My wife currently has Pixel 2 XL like that and contract is up, but mine is 4 XL and unfortunately its total loss, need new one and still have 1 year left on contract (till Dec 16th, 400$ left on ""balance"" which is kind of included in the plan price!).

Now I was thinking to get the Pixel 5 on my wife's name, but surprise!

* Rogers doesn't have it on the website
* Best Buy shows about 33$/month  for 2 years = \~800$!
* Rogers in store, say they ""must"" upgrade her plan to 20GB for 75$, she doesn't need it!

When we called service center, they magically ""found"" a 5gb plan for 55, but the numbers still don't add up - overall cost in 2 years, is more than 300+65$/month!

Is it stupid to not take on all this cheap debt right now?,"I am a housing bear and someone who actively avoids all debt; never had a missed payment on the credit card and never buy anything on installments. I live in a rental and save most of my income. I know, quite the weirdo.

But recently I have been trying to learn how the economy works and it seems like that if you don't take full advantage of all these recent COVID related economic measures you are bound to get screwed really soon. What I have been reading is that even though the government printed all this money and did all this QE, it will be extremely difficult to undo all these measures. Japan and Sweden for example never went back from negative interests. BoC promised keeping rates low till 2023 but a lot of economists say they will simply keep announcing low rates beyond that. Also, I have been reading that  even though we are at near zero rates and have done quite a lot of QE, the banks have another tool up their sleeves to hit that 2% inflation rate; currency devaluation. What this means means is that even though 1 million dollar homes outside the city sound insane right now, what might happen is that currency will devalue and a lot of wages will drastically adjust such that 1 million will not really sound that crazy anymore. Heck, we may even get UBI sooner than expected drastically increasing average household incomes.

If you watch all these politicians and BoC governor talk about these things they seem oddly content with extremely high home prices and household debt, as if this is completely normal. I can't point the video but I heard the BoC governor say in minced words that people should in fact be taking advantage of these rates. I also think the banks have all this calculated which is why they are handing out mortgages so easily.

Little background about myself:

\- 28M, GTA working as an engineer ($70,000/yr) in the energy sector, single, paid off my student loans (OSAP \~$30,000) and my car is paid off all by myself

\- Maxed TFSA (\~$71,000 in ETFs 50% XGRO, 25% XEQT, 25%XUS)

\- Maxed RRSP (\~$21000 in ETFs: 50% SPGM 50% SPLG)

\- $10,000 in an employer-matched Defined Contribution Pension Plan DCPP (sitting in Sunlife in an index fund: BLK LP Index 2055 Fund MER is 0.15%) - I do not have a choice where this is invested

\- $5000 HISA Savings emergency fund

\- Moved out at 18, never had a handout from parents as they were living paycheck to paycheck and they never graduated university (my dad never finished high school).

\- Rent is 700 all in (living with 2 roommates in the GTA)

Question is what to do next?

Here's a couple of ideas:

\- Buy a preconstruction condo in the GTA? Or house hunt inthe outer-GTA regions (Hamilton/Durham/Barrie) area to fix up and rent? (BRRRR)

\- Keep saving and be live debt-free in non-registered accounts & cryptos (Wealthsimple crypto & buy ETFs)?

Some notes:

\- Slight-lifesstyle creep: I want to move into a studio by myself, I've been living with roommates for a decade now (18-28), it would be nice to finally ""feel"" my accomplishment. But should I push out one more year to save up for my next move? (downpayment/cryptos)?

\- I REALLY feel like the condo market in Toronto is headed for a slight decrease in 2021 based on months of research and looking at prices in zillow (over-supply, with a sudden stoppage of immigration and foreign students due to covid). Maybe not as drastic as a crash or a correction. I'm in a little dilemma -should I wait another year, or make the jump? I don't think waiting 1 year in real-estate land will affect the price too drastically.

Insuring Luxury Watch: Moronic Monday,"I was waiting to post this in the Mornonic Monday thread but did not see any for today so here it is!

I recently purchased a luxury watch (5k+). I own a condo and have home insurance, however from what I've read over the past years usually this home insurance is not comprehensive enough for someone who will be wearing their luxury watch often.

So anyone have any idea how I should go about this? Currently in Quebec. 


P.S: Also any other financial tips regarding the watch?? Currently setting $25 a month aside for future maintenance on the watch",18,1609813637.0,2021,2021-01-04,Insurance,UnseenHeroz,0,kqocaf
Next choice in personal finance journey,"Hey everyone,

I’m looking for some input and opinions for the next step in my investment future.  I’m in my mid 30s, own my own home and a duplex investment property.  Both homes have 600k mortgages but are worth approx 1 million based on today’s market.  The rental property is 1000 a month cash positive after all carrying costs.  I’ve got 250k invested in rrsps and 0 in TFSA.  

I’ve recently sold a separate investment property and am going to clear 220 k on the sale.

My question to all of you is what would be the best thing to do with the 220k.  I’m tempted to invest into another rental property as vacancy rates are very low where I live and I feel confident that homes won’t be losing value in the future.  

I also know that I have 80k of rrsp contribution space and 60k in TFSA.  So in my heart I feel it makes sense to top off those accounts even though it’s not as sexy as buying more property.  

Thirdly I would like to purchase a chunk of property for hunting/fishing/building a legacy cabin to pass on,  but am unsure of wether or not that’s a prudent move at this point.

Thanks for all your help.",10,1609812654.0,2021,2021-01-04,,cdn-finance,0,kqo1ue

Tax deductions for basement suites,"Well it's that time of year again - tax questions :).  Sorry in advance...

I'm familiar with the usual subjects.   Percentage of floor space occupied by suite is how I allocate stuff like mortgage interest, property taxes, utilities (they're included), etc.    Easy peasy.

This year I put in about $4k in landscaping work and it's mostly around the entry to my suite.   Arguably structural, it was a retaining wall I put in for aesthetic purposes.   It is structural.

Looking at the tax law there are four criteria I need to meet.   However I can't tell if this is divisible by area rented or full amount.   Everything I read takes me to full amount.    I mean it's mostly by the entrance to the suite instead of my main floor and provides nominal new value.    

I know sidewalks must be amortized, but what about retaining walls?  Sod?  Topsoil?     Basically I terraced my yard so it's easier to mow ( no word of a lie ).  

As well, can I deduct the expense of gutter cleaning?    It feels wrong but nothing says I can't.  It is going towards maintenance of the property.  Kinda makes sense that I can deduct it no?

What about pest control?   I had a bird in my roof this year and paid a pest control guy.     Is that deductable?",4,1609812413.0,2021,2021-01-04,,rainman_104,0,kqnz0d

Doesn't this mean that a lot less Americans will default on their mortgages if interest rates go way up? 

Let's say that the vaccine is super effective, covid19 recovery is strong, stimulus causes inflation to  rampage out of control, treasury yields go way up and ultimately mortgage prices sky-rocket... in that scenario: are most Canadians totally screwed?

Auto insurance advice (Ontario),"Hi everyone,

This is my first post, not sure if this is the correct forum. But I think it helps to get some advice.

I’m up for my auto insurance renewal (2017 Toyota vehicle still on lease) and was told that the risk rating for my vehicle has gone up (due to large number of claims on this particular model), and thus my premium as well. I’ve been trying to find some data on the risk ratings for auto insurance. Can anyone point me at some sources? 

I’m concerned since all my driving metrics (alumni discount, driving habit tracker, location etc. ) have improved leading to discounts but this risk factor alone has pushed the rate up. This is what the insurer explained me. Not sure if I’m missing something. But what I’ve realized (not sure if it’s correct) knowing this metric this can help folks make even better purchase decisions on vehicles.

Thank you.

Edit: I’m sorry that I didn’t word it better. I wanted to see if anyone else here knew about this risk profile / risk rating for vehicle models. Where to find them.",6,1609811661.0,2021,2021-01-04,,pragmatic_human99,1,kqnqn1

Broker Mortgage Rates Jan 2021,"Happy New Year's guys.  Just giving an update on the best rates via the broker channel for mortgages.  You can use these rates to gauge the rates your bank / credit union is quoting you.

For insured purchases (less than 20% down payment), you're looking at rates starting at 1.30% 5-year variable (Prime -1.15%) or 1.39% 5-year fixed (rates may be a bit higher depending on location and closing date).  If the mortgage is uninsured (20% or more down), you're looking at rates starting at 1.40% 5-year variable (Prime -1.05%) or 1.39% 5-year fixed.

For transfers/renewals, you're looking at rates starting at 1.40% 5-year variable or 1.44% 5-year fixed.  Rates will vary depending on LTV (loan to value), location, closing/renewal date...

If anybody wants an exact quote, I am happy to give you one in the comments section. I need to know:

For a **mortgage transfer/renewal**:

\-How much is the mortgage owing?  
\-Roughly, what is the current market value of the property?  
\-Which city is the property located in?  
\-Is the property owner-occupied or a rental?  
\-Who is your current lender?  
\-Do you have a HELOC tied to the mortgage?  
\-Is the mortgage CMHC insured?  
\-When did you buy the property?  
\-When is your renewal date?

For a **purchase of a property**:

\-What is the purchase price?  
\-How much is the down payment?  
\-Where it the property located?  
\-When is the closing date?  
\-Will the property be owner-occupied or a rental?

For a **mortgage refinance**:

\-Roughly, what is the current market value of the property?  
\-What is the current mortgage owing?  
\-How much do you want to borrow (refinance)?  
\-Is the property owner-occupied or a rental?  
\-Where is the property located?  
\-When do you want to close on the refinance?

Whenever you are borrowing MORE money than currently owing or INCREASING the remaining amortization period, it is a refinance.",196,1609797915.0,2021,2021-01-04,,MortgageSense,31,kqj7ot

Investment options for $CDN for US tax residents,"Hello,

I've been living in the US for a while now but I am a Canadian Citizen and I have money in Canada that has been sitting in a bank account getting inflated away.  Long term goals are to move back to Canada at some point in the next ten years so I don't really want to transfer all the money to USD and then back to CAD but maybe I can be convinced otherwise.

Tax Claim Implications due to Covid-19 Pandemic,"I’m sure this has been posted here already but I can’t find the post.

I read the following articles on how to claim home office expenses 2020 and I’m trying to understand this correctly:

* 3.	https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-229-other-employment-expenses/work-space-home-expenses/expenses-can-claim.html
* 4.	https://www.moneysense.ca/save/taxes/income-tax-t2200/ 
* 5.	https://www.benefitscanada.com/news/employers-can-now-reimburse-up-to-500-tax-free-for-home-office-furniture-151928 this source says up to $500 but other ones say $400? Who is correct?

So, if I choose to use the “Detailed Method” I would be allowed the claim my monthly Internet fees? 
So I would add up (I’m assuming the before tax monthly cost) of my internet from March-December 2020. So if I paid $100 a month (before tax – total bill would be $113 then), I could claim 10 months = $1000 (March – December)? 

So am I allowed to claim only the Internet or would I have to try and calculate the rest to fill in the form? (this would be due to my laziness of not wanting to have to calculate the other amounts, but since Internet costs me more than the flat $400 it may be worth just doing this)

But if I used this method, I cannot also claim using the flat method, and lose out on the $400? 

Also am I understanding these forms right for who should use which form and when?

* Temporary Flat Rate Method = no form needed = laziest way to get the $400

* Detailed Method = Form T2200**S** = you used to show up in person but now work from home due to the 2020 pandemic

* Detailed Method = Form T2200 = Either Self employed or Not self employed and you already worked from home before the 2020 Pandemic

My question is, can he take the write off amount and use the proceeds to pay the repair and thus keep the car? Or is he obligated to get rid of the car after it has been ""written off"" by the insurance company?

Thanks

Suggestion on USD in Questrade,"Hey All,

A while back I bought a few shares of Tesla in an otherwise pretty CCP portfolio. I sold them and will keep money to pay capital gain taxes as these were in my Margin account, but I settle in USD on those so as not to pay FX fees until I know what I want to do. 

I am wondering what you would suggest if you were in my position? I am thinking the options are:

1) keep USD because who knows when I may want to buy stocks that's aren't listed on TSX? Could also be used as a currency hedge?

2) Transfer to CAD (Norberts Gambit) to put into CCP ETFs.

3) Other? Would it be suggested to invest in CCP like ETFs, but on the US exchange? Any issues with that or disadvantages on taxes or anything?

How does accounting work for projects where I need to buy parts first? ie: computer builds,"Hey everyone,

Over the holidays I've had quite a few people reach out to me to build them computers most of the time people would buy the parts and I would just build it for them and they'd give me $20-$50. Since I am a sole prop I do send an invoice and that makes the accounting a little bit easier.

Now my question is what happens when I need to purchase the parts first? I do have a GST number since I'm a freelancer but how do I account for the parts I buy? 

Do I just put them on my business CC, and then invoice the total amount (including the pst and gst?) and the service fee? I'm wondering because I don't want to charge the extra 5% on the total build of the pc with parts but rather just the 5% for the service fee.

Or do I just discount the parts of the PC by 5% and then charge the GST on the total of the invoice?

How did you figure out your first real estate investment strategy?,"Hi all,

I just graduated from grad school, still looking for employment but thinking about my personal finances. I opened up RRSP and TFSA accounts a couple of years ago and also just recently got into understanding stocks. I've heard that real estate investment and putting up property for rent is the way to go for long term investments but not sure how I should start thinking about it - I would love to save up to have an investment in a few years time but not sure how much. For those of you who do have an investment  how did you:

1. Figure out how much cash down payment you needed? Did you look up real estate listings and ballpark the amount? Did you talk to people you knew or kept in touch with what's on sale in the area?
2. How long did it take you to save up the amount you needed? And how much was that for you approximately?
3. Did you decide when you were saving if you wanted to specifically invest in a home/condo/other or was it based on how much you saved?

Should I be saving for a down payment or invest for retirement?,"I'm a new grad making $80,000/year in the Toronto area. I payed off my student loans with money I saved from internships through university and just finished building an emergency fund. I'm fortunate enough to live with my parents and can save almost my entire paycheck (about $4000/month). 

Now I'm anxious about what my next steps should be. Should I start maxing my TFSA and RRSP to save for retirement or prioritize saving for a condo down payment so I can move out of my parents house?

My family is strongly pushing me to buy a 1 bedroom starter condo in Toronto that would go for $500,000. Unlike how it sounds, they're not just pushing me out of their house. I've tried to give them rent but they refused it by telling me to put it towards a house instead. They're also against the idea of me renting elsewhere because ""it's a waste of money when you could be building equity"". 

I appreciate that they're looking out for my financial health and are really thinking about my best interests. But even with their help, I don't know if I can really afford a condo in Toronto or if I'm mentally ready to take on that much debt. My parents are fist generation immigrants and don't have a lot, but they put a lot of importance on owning real estate and want to pool whatever money they have to help me buy a house. Even to the point of taking out a lien on their house. 

I feel really guilty about taking money from them but I don't want to let them down.

Is it a good decision for me to buy my car at the end of my lease?,"Hi PFC. I'm an absolute beginner to personal finance and I know nothing about cars, so I was hoping for some opinions.

I currently lease a 2017 Honda Fit, and I pay about $340 a month for it. I started leasing this car in May 2017 because I got a job that required a car, and I wasn't sure how long I'd be in the job (and therefore how long I'd want a car). Fast forward to now, I anticipate needing a car for the rest of my career.

I love my Honda Fit and would be happy to keep driving it, and I own winter tires for it. It has maybe 61,000 km on it and very minimal damage (a small handful of little scratches & dings). In my leasing paperwork it looks like the lease is up in May 2021 and it says the purchase price at the 'lease maturation date' will be about $9,200. 

This seems like a great deal to me for a used car that I already love and have been taking good care of.  I have some money saved and could pay it all upfront. I would love to not make lease payments anymore, but I have nothing to compare this price to and I don't know much about the costs of car ownership (repairs, how it may impact my insurance rate, etc). I also keep getting calls and texts from the car dealership wanting to buy back the car from me and promising me a really good deal on something else if I let them buy back the Fit.

This may seem like a stupid question, but, what is the best way to get this information to my accountant at tax time? I want to add more to the TFSA prior to the deadline, but, I know the Margin and TFSA contributions in 2021 won't matter for 2020 filing.

Refinance for lower rate?,"I’ve had 3 different answers from 3 different lenders! 
So I’m looking for some opinions/insight. 

Current rate 3.39% 620k left on the mtg, 2 years left in the term. 21k penalty to break current mortgage. 

New mortgage: 1.64% 5 year term. 

Broker A just sent me this:
Refinance 
$646,000 @ 1.64% ($625+$21)
$322/month payment savings 
$992/month interest savings
“Broker answer”
Over 5 year term you save $78,840 minus your penalty 
My answer 
You save $1314 per month for how ever many months you have left on your term. And then it all depends on where rates are at when you would have had to refinance on your current term.

Transferring RRSP advice,"Okay,

So as I learn more about investing I see some of the things I did when I was younger probably not the greatest idea.

So I have two RRSP with RBC

1. One is unlocked in an aggressive profile though it is about a 40/40 split with USA Canada equities, has a 2.56 MER (which I now know is high) and the mutual fund is just a fund of funds, meaning the holdings inside are just more funds with many of them RBC funds which is great for them.
2. I also have a locked RRSP that has a more balanced with about 25% in USA,Canada and International Equity Funds and 23% in Income Funds, again a lot of the top holdings also include RBC Funds and again it is a Fund of Funds with an MER of 2.36

Calendar Returns for the fund in number 1 for example have been the following:

2010  10.2%  
2011   7.2%(negative)  
2012   10.4%  
2013  25.2%  
2014 11.3%  
2015 7.4%  
2016 5.5%  
2017 13.4%  
2018 6.2% (negative)  
2019 18.0  
2020 YTD 6.9%   


So Questions

So I am thinking can I move these to Wealthsimple etc and do a lot better? obviously the MER is terrible for these, though perhaps I could get them to lower it?

I know you have to do a direct transfer so you do not get dinged with taxes during the move of the funds.  What exactly moves over?  The whole fund as is now with all the holdings? Or just the money moves over and then I make choices on what to do with it?

What would you guys do with these RRSP's leave them as they are? Try to get a better rate?(is that even a thing with the banks?) Move them to another platform and have WS management them based on risk assessment? Or move them and manage them yourself? like VRGO etc

"Hi folks, I need help understanding something with my self directed TFSA","I have contributed 69,500 to my TFSA in total, maxed it out every year.

My situation is that I am a trader, I trade pretty much everything and I am good at seeing the trends. I have grown my TFSA from a total deposits of 69,500 up to current year, to just over 300k in cumulative trading up until this point over many years. Before we get into ""But thats not how youre supposed to use your TFSA, its not designed for trading!"" All I am interested in is what's legal, and this is legal. I limit myself in numbers of trades, to not be considered a day trader and have had no issues with CRA being upset by this behaviour, after all, the bank gave me a self directed account, I'm self directing it.

I would like to grow this even further and will be talking to my accountant but I wanted to discuss this here as I won't see them until next week. It basically involves the reallocation of stocks that are held outside of a TFSA and moving them into the TFSA to protect them from capital gains taxes and so on, but I won't bore with the details.

Now, if I understand correctly, anything you withdraw from the TFSA can be re-contributed the following year - I'm not sure if this applies to the predefined contribution amount, or literally ANTHING you withdraw. Here is my question:

1. Does this apply to any amount withdrawn? In other words, if I withdraw 100k, does my contribution room next year grow by 100k? Can I put the 100k back in? Or do I only get contribution room up to the value that is specified by yearly contribution limits, ie. withdraw 100k and can only replace 69,500.

The goal would be to take tax free profits on my trades, while simultaneously increasing the amount I can recontribute from salary or liquidation of stocks held personally outside the TFSA, replacing that fuel into the TFSA for more growth.

Conversely, if I only get 69,500 of recontribution room, then there is no reason to take more than 69,500 of profit out, because I will not be allowed to recontribute that.

In a worst case, that I only get recontribution room equal to the year that it was taken out, then that makes this whole thing pointless.

TLDR; I've made profit in my TFSA, want to move stocks held outside of TFSA into the TFSA.

Can I withdraw from TFSA in excess of the predefined contribution room to increase re-contribution room the following year? Thus making room for stocks held elsewhere to move into the TFSA.

In other words, and very simply

1) Remove profit of 100k from TFSA

2) Replace 100k next year with externally held liquidated stocks",8,1609787465.0,2021,2021-01-04,Taxes,87321,0,kqfhcc

Guide on Paying Off CMHC FTHBI Incentive,"I was paying back CMHC down payment incentive during the holidays (congratulations to me!). Since there're no resources available on here and other sites, I figure I'll write one. Let me know if I'm missing something!

**What is CMHC FTHBI incentive?**

* CMHC will help you pay 5% or 10% down payment when you bought a property. See [here](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/nhs/first-time-home-buyer-incentive) for more details.
* You will have to pay back **market price** before 25 years or when you sell your house, whichever is earlier.

**What is good about FTHBI?**

* Lower CMHC default insurance fee. If you need FTHBI, you must be paying the default insurance. Use this site [here](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/finance-and-investing/mortgage-loan-insurance/homebuying-calculators/mortgage-calculator) to calculate the difference. In my case, I'm saving $3.5K alone from mortgage insurance. This is almost the only reason I'd recommend this incentive.
* Your monthly mortgage payment will go down, but technically you need to pay the difference back.

**What is bad about FTHBI?**

* Paying back the market rate. For example, I bought my place in lava hot market. I paid my loan back in one year and it's already shooting up by $1.5K. The formula is (market price - purchase price) x 5%.
* You can only pay back in one lump sum. Lower stress from lower monthly payment is offset by playing catch up with the market to pay back the loan. There's also hidden fee which I'll explain later.
* You can't rent out your property **ever** if you haven't paid FTHBI off. Maybe I'm wrong but it's according to the manual [here](https://assets.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/sites/place-to-call-home/fthbi/fthbi-operational-policy-manual-en.pdf).  

**What is weird about FTHBI?**

* How is the government making houses more affordable when they jump into the same pool with us? I don't get it but who am I to say.

**How I paid back FTHBI?**

1. Email CMHC to let them know I'm paying back incentive. They told me to appraise my property according to *Appendix A* [here](https://assets.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/sites/place-to-call-home/fthbi/fthbi-operational-policy-manual-en.pdf).
2. Book an appraiser to value your property's market rate. He/she will survey 3 properties around you and come up with market price. My appraiser costs $450 after tax.
3. Once the appraiser gave me the report, let CMHC know. My report wasn't sent directly to CMHC so I emailed it to them.
4. CMHC will calculate 5% of appraised price plus additional admin fee (discharge and processing) of $220. They sent me a receipt with an instruction on how to pay.
5. I went to my bank to pay off the amount above. My bank charged $50 for EFT. Me and bank clerk triple checked the numbers to make sure there were no typos.
6. A few days later CMHC confirmed they received my payment and discharge my mortgage.

**Was FTHBI worth it?**

* I approximate the gain/loss is below with my example. Of course this is a lazy formula so don't 100% trust it.
* FTHBI Gain = Insurance Discount - Market Gain - Appraisal - CMHC Admin - EFT
* In my case, +1270 = 3500 - 1500 - 450 - 230 - 50. So fortunately I netted positive.

**My conclusion on FTHBI**

* If your house drops in value, you'll have a good time paying. But well your house value drops so either way in both scenarios are not really happy endings...",6,1609786358.0,2021,2021-01-04,Housing,courtlandave,16,kqf2x0

Wrong Transfer Directions from Manulife on the phone,"Helping my wife move her Group RRSP funds from Sun Life to Manulife and called Manulife to try to find out where the damn form was.

Found the form after getting a human on the line and decided to make sure it was the right one and are sending it as they instructed, thankfully they have upload document options, unlike some Fin Institutions that require you to snail mail (OR FAX?!?!?) forms.

Person on the phone said I needed T2033 and I had to send it to the relinquishing inst (SL) while the document I found said I filled out their form and send it to receiving inst (ML).

I asked them twice if this was the right way, they said yes, then asked ""what about the 'Transfer Authorization for Registered Investments' form?"", they said, yes that's the one. But it says it goes to ML, not SL. ""oh, okay"". Needless to say, they did not sound confident in their answer.

Everyone, just remember these companies are huge and have lots of different people of varying skill and experience. This person was going through the motions as they were trained, saying all the things they need to about timing of the transfer dependent on the relinquishing inst, etc., but they aren't all well trained or experience everything with the right answer.

"People who used the FTHBI, how many % did you put down on top of it?","Hey PFC! 

Me and my girlfriend are buying a 220K$ condo in Quebec. We are eligible for the FTHBI https://www.placetocallhome.ca/fthbi/first-time-homebuyer-incentive

It's a program that loans first time home buyers 5% of the value of the property to be bought. It's a ""no interest"" loan that needs to be paid back when the house is sold down the line +appreciation. So let's say in our case they give us 11 000$ and our house sells for 250 000$ in 10 years, we would owe the government 12 500$ on that sell. 

Our plan is to put an additional 5-7.5% cash down on top of the FTHBI. So, on our 220 000$ home, we'd get 11K from the gov and put down an extra 11K ourselves for a total of 22K or 10% cash down. According to our financial advisor, we can put up to 19.99% cash down total but we can't cross the 20% treshold because then the FTHBI doesn't apply, anyway we prefer to stay within 5%-7.5% cash down of our own cash. 

My question is : How much did you put down on top of the 5% FTHBI (if any, some people don't put any of their own cash down) and why?",3,1609784546.0,2021,2021-01-04,Housing,Thisnickname,0,kqefwx
Buying USD stock on Questrade regsutered account,"Hi All,

&#x200B;

I have been doign some reserach into buying US stock inside a TFSA account and Norberts Gambit, but from my understanding if its inside a registered account you dont need to convert your CAD into USD because it is already automatically done for you? So you dont need to do Norerts Gambit inside the TFSA?

&#x200B;

This is what the Questrade website says:

&#x200B;

> Registered accounts such as TFSA, RRSP, or RRIF offer many special tax benefits that are not available to margin account holders. At the same time, these accounts carry some restrictions. For example, one of the key differences between registered and non-registered accounts is that with registered accounts, you cannot borrow funds to invest and for that reason, the two account types are built differently.  
>  
>**Let's use an example:**  
>  
>Suppose you hold $12,000 CAD and $0 USD in your TFSA account and you decide to buy $2,500 of a U.S. stock. After making the purchase, your USD cash balance will be negative for the total cost of the trade ($2,500 + plus commissions), and your CAD balance will stay the same at $12,000 for the day of the trade.  
>  
>Since investors are not allowed to borrow money in registered accounts, Questrade will automatically convert the required amount of CAD cash to cover the negative USD balance of $2,500 at the end of the trading day, based on the market’s daily CAD:USD exchange rate. Questrade will take as much as we need from your $12,000 CAD to cover the purchase of $2,500 USD to bring your account balance to zero so you’re not borrowing money from us.  
>  
>For example, if CAD and USD were at par 1:1, once the exchange is completed, your CAD balance would be at $9,500CAD and 0 USD.  
>  
>At times, negative balances could also occur in registered accounts as result of inactivity fees, data fees or due to mandatory payments made from your registered account to you. Customers who carry a negative cash balance in their registered accounts will typically get a detailed email with a request to make a payment within a specific timeframe.

Am I understandign things correctly?

"We're (22F, 22M) graduating into 630k salary with zero financial knowledge","Hi PersonalFinanceCanada,

In the last week or so, my boyfriend and I signed full time offers which nets us 630k CAD per year (base+bonus+stock/year) between the two of us (Me: 280k, Him: 350k) and allows us to work remotely from wherever. We want to try out living in different provinces/states. Now the problem comes - how on earth do we manage this money?? I currently keep my money in a Chequings account for god's sake.

We currently both have no student debt, and each have around 50k CAD in savings from internships. My parents bought a car for me so no payments there, but insurance will be around 500 a month.

How do we make a good life for ourselves? Any suggestions for investments? Should I look into downpayment for an apartment? (I would want to purchase this on my own for now) Should I put the money in stocks? I've also heard of a thing called TFSA?

Thanks for all suggestions!

Is my mortgage broker being honest?,"Hello,

So I am in the early process of a cash out refinance on my home with a mortgage broker.  I also have a condo rental property whose mortgage I’m leaving as is.  My broker is telling me that for some of the big 5 lenders, they will not count the maintenance or utility fees on the condo rental property when they calculate my debt service ratios.  They will only count the mortgage principal and interest, and property taxes, so obviously my borrowing power is greater.  However, I don’t see how this is possible.  Can any brokers out there confirm?  I don’t want to go through the hard credit checks if in the end I’m not able to cash out the amount my broker is telling me.

Some quick Questrade Questions,"Hey all,

Sorry if these are duplicate questions, I did some googling but didn't find what I was looking for. This is probably because I don't even know what to google. :)

1. Is there a way to be sure I don't use the margin on my account? I put $1000 in cash into the account and want to be very careful because as mentioned, I don't really know what I'm doing. It makes me nervous that it's showing my buying power as $2657. Some people online talk about accidentally using margin because of currency conversions, is that a thing to watch for?

2. Why does my ""Maint excess"" not matching my ""Cash""? My understanding was that ""Buying power"" includes margin and ""Maint excess"" doesn't, but my cash is currently $174 and my Maint excess is $798 - where is the extra coming from?

3. Is there a specific meaning to the letters after the period on stock symbols? For example AC.TO and NOU.VN? What do the .TO and .VN mean?

Best way to completely dissolve my corporation?,"Hey all,

Vancouver/Burnaby Condo or slow and steady 2% savings account,"45 years old, single, take home income $65k net, and presently rent an apartment in downtown Vancouver for $2150/m+$100 parking near the beaches in a nice new building.

I have about $150k that is sitting at 2% which I move between accounts in order to get the most interest income.  I have found some brand new construction condos in east vancouver, north vancouver, burnaby, and maybe richmond that I am thinking about putting $115-$150k downpayment on a $420-$450k condo.

I think the timing might be ok since the spring will likely push prices up, and I don't want to miss out again like in the past.  Should I pull the trigger, and sit on it for a few years or longer?  Or just keep the money in the bank and wait and see approach?

I was considering investing in other things but stocks etc even low risk mutual fund accounts kind of scare me vs real estate, and I guess the biggest issue is that i'm wasting money in rent and could actually save monthly costs by buying as even with strata, taxes, etc my monthly costs should still be under $2k/month.

"BOC 2% inflation target, why?","Simple question why 2%, is it arbitrary or are there central bank fundamentals that make 2% meaningful.

It seems that with deflationary pressure from globalization and automation targeting a CPI greater than 0 has created a negative feed back loop for the central bank over night interest rate and QE. Ie, the cheaper you can borrow money the more you can invest in automation and reduce costs; making it possible to lower prices for your product and therefor reducing the CPI.

If the BOC targeted a CPI of 0% lets say, they could be rising interest rates right now as CPI is 1%. Not necessarily a good idea in the midst of a global pandemic. However if they had been targeting 0% over the last 5 years (pre coivd) the interest rate would be much closer to historic norms; making a reduction during a pandemic much more effective.

In desperate need of some advice,"In desperate need of some advice

Hi, I have had an interesting year since March 2020 and I think I've more than likely fucked myself over huge, but I'm not sure where to go from here. Any help would be great. 

- it started in March 2020 when I got let go from my FT job due to lack of hours for the store. I applied for CERB when it first started with no hassle. 

- in June 2020, I moved (I originally lived with my parents) into an apartment with my partner and neither of us had work. Just CERB (only one of us qualifed) and what remained of an inheritance fund ( >$10,000). How we managed to pull that one off I'm not sure. 

- October 2020: CERB has ended, and I was unsure of what to do next. Rather than asking people for advice, I just decided to apply for EI. No issues, I was accepted the same day I made the claim.

The problem comes from the fact that I was still looking for work, and was able to find a couple part time jobs here and there. Now, I was (and still kind of am) under immense stress with the ongoing pandemic, lockdowns, and the soul crushing reality of adulthood hitting me everyday. I suffer from mental health issues and there seemed to be a problem everywhere i looked.  I could barely get out of bed most days, let alone make it in to whatever job I was working at the time. I was also never making nearly enough money to pay for anything like rent (going from 60-80hr pays to 30-40, and being the sole income of the house at the time to boot). So, I just kept collecting EI while I went in and out of jobs. I never bothered to count the shifts I worked in my reports because by the time I went to fill another report, I wouldve already scared myself out of another job. So while the people working for EI accepted my claim based on an ROE I received in March of 2020, I have another 4 ROEs from after my EI claim was approved that say I've quit all these jobs. I am currently working a Part time Job that's only giving me 14 hours a week, which will barely cover rent for the month as it is. I have made the effort to actually report my earnings properly with this job, but am still in need of the extra money from EI or somewhere else because I can't do it working 14 hours a week. 

All the while, Service Canada and CRA have both been having chronic issues with certain parts of the site not being accessible or being under constant maintenance. I haven't been able to change my mailing address online and have yet to make a phone call, although I feel it will need to happen soon. 

So I guess what I am asking is, what the hell should I do? Am I committing fraud? I never wanted to do anything wrong, I think I made a few really stupid decisions along the way. I'm desperate to find a job that can actually help me pay my bills and I'm terrified of the upcoming tax season. But I'm still struggling to show up to work as it is, and I can't seem to reconcile any of this in my brain. Any advice on alltopics would be seriously appreciated.",7,1609768412.0,2021,2021-01-04,,neighborlybuttplug,3,kq95pt

- 30% VUN (more exposure to US markets)

If I have another lender offering me the terms as CIBC, without the cash back, how much would they need to lower their rate to match the cash back benefit?

I thought about it in two ways and it gives me vastly different answers... Assuming 1.7% fixed 5 year term:

&#x200B;

**OPTION A)** Apparently it's worth 0.14% interest rate?

$2000/60 months = $33.33/month

1.7% interest on a 500k mortgage = $2046/month

1.56% interest on a 500k mortgage = $2013/month (i.e. $2046 - $33)

BACKGROUND:

As a young, first-generation, and independent immigrant in their early 20s, they graduated from a college with a diploma in Hotel and Tourism Management. Promptly after graduation they found employment within the management team of a prominent Toronto hotel on a post-graduate work permit. They held the role of a Coordinator and managed vendors during events, staff scheduling, and reconciliation of accounts. 

During their time in employment, they developed a liking for finance and investing. So they enrolled in an online learning institution to attain a diploma in Finance. However, in only less than 2 years, they  were laid off after the industry took a blow from the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020. 

With their free time, they fast-tracked course completion to graudate with a diploma in Financial Asset Management. Towards the end of 2020, they took up multiple minimum wage jobs to help pay for rent. However, with tuition payments on top of living expense, cash flow is in the negative. 

They only have handful of months left on their work permit. And they desperately want to get their foot in the door of the finance industry preferably as an entry level Financial Analyst, however they are willing to start anywhere, including Bank Teller. But they are facing rejection at every step. So they are now considering getting certification to help realize that goal. 

Unfortunately, they don't have a lay of the land, so to speak. And with funds drying up, they can't afford to invest their time and money in the wrong certification. With one shot left, their back is against the wall and it feels very hopeless. They can no longer see a path forward. How to proceed in order to be a contender to get a foot in the door?

Kindly offer some guidance. Thank you in advance.

"Loan in collections, debt collector hasn't reported?","Throwaway because my main can be linked to me IRL. So when I was young and dumb (5 years ago) I got an student loan (bank made it a personal LOC, apparently) of $10k. Me, not understanding how such things work, didn't notice I was 3 months behind on payments and the bank sent it to collections. Since I was in college, I also didn't get the collections letters for another 6 months (dad doesn't open my mail).

So here is my situation - the loan has since been charged off, and the $10k is listed as derogatory/charge off on my Transunion report. This was reported by the bank, and the loan has since changed hands twice with neither debt collector reported this debt. I just graduated from a 6 year program, and am looking to fix my credit report. I figure I could wait another 2 years for it to drop, but since RBC has sold the debt, would it be possible for me to get RBC to remove the derogatory mark, and then work with the debt collectors? Not entirely sure what my **best** options are.

I am in Ontario, went to school out west, and loan was acquired here. ",6,1609733686.0,2021,2021-01-03,Debt,financialmistaker,0,kq0y95
AGF fund,"Just starting to learn more about investing but I unfortunately got suckered into investing in mutual funds with Primerica last year when I had no idea what I was doing. Now that I'm realizing it's a scam I'm considering pulling out. When I was investing I did have my reservations about it so I only put a small portion of my money into it and I'm not putting regular payments into it, just letting the initial investment grow. I'm pretty confident that I won't need this money anytime soon and can ride out the 7 years it would take to cancel the DSC fees. My investment has been doing well and growing. But what I'm wondering is, should I take my money and run asap and swallow those DSC fees or should I ride it out for the next few years so I don't have to pay them or at least, reduce them. As said earlier, I don't think I'll be needing the money anytime soon but my main concern is how well the fund will perform over time. This may sound paranoid but given the sketchy nature of the company, I'm a bit concerned of my money disappearing. Is this a legitimate concern or is there anything else I would need to worry about if I decide to stay with them?

"Need advice! Signed a lease takeover for a room in an apartment in Toronto starting Jan, 2021 and could be in a soup.","The apartment has 3 rooms plus a den/office, and there were 4 residents. At the time of my initial visit, they showed me a separate room that was becoming available, but it was off my budget. Late November, I arranged with the tenant who was occupying the den and paid him the rent for Dec to move-in early.

Fast forward to today, the other room has become vacant and the original tenants could not find a new tenant. I’ve been hearing some discussion of splitting the rent of the vacant room by 3 and the such.  I’d like to keep the room as I have invested in painting and collecting furniture to make it cozy, but not at a rate that is rent plus the split. 

We never discussed the original agreement, and in hindsight, I should have insisted on seeing it to figure what’s the total rent due today as the original lease is from 2015. Except for leaving some innuendos here and there about splitting, it was never discussed with me but am sure it's a conversation I have to tackle in the next few days. 

My sublease agreement is with the builder directly and mentions only what I have to pay for my room. Considering my original agreement was from Jan 2021, I wouldn’t have moved in if I had to pay rent plus split. The builder during an early email interaction confirmed my agreement is on a month-to-month basis with two months of notice on either parties.

Could you advise what do I do in this situation?

TL;DR - Signed a lease, but moved in early. A tenant has moved out with notice to the original tenants and they don't have anyone to replace him. I may be asked to pay the split off of the vacant room and I don't want to.

Well, mission accomplished. Anything I save over that I move into an ETF. 

I’m not sure about where to keep my emergency fund though, right now it’s in a standard savings account earning me next to nothing.

"Student Loans, a Mortgage and Financial Illiteracy","I (30f/British Columbia) have just finished university and am waiting to be hired with my local school district as a teacher. Because of my lack of financial planning I owe just shy of $60,000 in student loans (provincial has no interest and federal is around 2.5% I think), $4000 in credit card debt, and around $195,000 left on a private mortgage. This mortgage is actually held on a line of credit at 4.45% compounded monthly. I share the mortgage debt with my brother, and he has paid down his half more than I have, so I’m personally responsible for about $100,000. My minimum required payment for my mortgage is $750, my minimum for student loans will be about $550. 

Once I begin working I’m certain I can afford $1000 payments for each, plus $250 towards my credit card until that’s paid off then the $250 will go into emergency fund. This will see me paying off student loans in around 5-7 years depending on when I have kids and what kind of income I will have on maternity leave throughout those years. 

I really am financially illiterate. I have a TFSA with Scotiabank that I always treated as a savings account, but I guess this isn’t the best use? I have started budgeting properly as of this month while I make the transition into having full time, reliable income. I have a partner and he struggles to keep long-term employment, not ideal, but I love him and he’s working on it. 

Basically what I’m wondering is if I’m taking the right approach to handling my debt? Am I missing something major that I should be putting money towards? I never learned how to budget or navigate big financial decisions (clearly!) so I’m open to any and all advice.",24,1609729856.0,2021,2021-01-03,Debt,coffeebean04,6,kpzudd

Budget & Expense Tracker Template for 2021 for Beginners (Google Sheets),"Happy New Year!

Drawing inspiration from a more advanced personal budgeting tool posted here a few days ago, I decided to edit the one I made for myself and share it with you all. I hope this is an easy way to start tracking your expenses. Note: make a copy for the Google sheets version!

[Link here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rvOfOXlo7pvQExfNJSRRO7wQHf9RMxygkF436UwOlkg/edit?usp=sharing) to the Google Sheets drive.

Dashboard: You can see your monthly expenses grouped by the categories you personally customize. You can enter a maximum set limit per category, which will flag any month where you overspent. Furthermore, you can see a visualization of your spending per month (bar chart) and see where your total expenses go towards (pie graph).

**Instructions**

1. Getting your Data: Download your payment transactions from your bank through the 'CSV' format. If you have cash receipts, keeping those helps you track your spend.
2. Summarize your spend: Group your spending into certain categories. Enter them in the 'Categories' tab of this worksheet. Items in blue fonts are places where you can make your edits. Helping you summarize your spending allows you to see where you are spending the most. Do not delete rows in the categories tab - you can choose to leave them blank.
3. Enter your data: Start to enter your income and expenses in the 'Data' tab. Under the categories, group your expenses to the best fitting category. Be sure to include the dates and where you spent. Optional: Add more details on your expenses in the 'details' column.
4. Analyze: After entering in those details - go into the 'Dashboard'. Enter your monthly maximum spend per category in the 'Maximum Allotted' row. Anything higher than that figure will be highlighted in that particular month above.
5. Conclusion: Keeping a budget helps you track your spending to see where you might be overspending. The budget also helps you double check any fraudulent transactions!

Wallet Theft - Info," 

Hi Guys,

I felt this was the closest group that would be in a similar setting (In canada, personal finance / investments) I thought I'd post this here.

My wallet was stolen from my truck last night and in it were :

* 1x Company Credit Card (VISA) provided by my job for gas expenses on the company vehicle
* 1x Personal BMO Credit Card
* 1x Personal BMO Debit Card
* Driver's license and healthcare card (PITA to retrieve new copies specially during COVID)
* 100$ in cash

As  a wrap-up, this morning at 5:45 AM the bank sent me an E-mail message  alerting me of suspicious activity which I only saw at 9AM when I got  up. Curious I logged into my bank account to find money was spent on my  personal credit card AND on my debit card at two local corner stores  that are within 5km of where I live. This made me automatically slip a  coat on to confirm my wallet was removed from the truck and that a mess  was made of other papers in the storage compartments. I had all cards  confirmed cancelled and new cards posted to me.

Since  I don't get direct alerts for the company VISA, I called and was able  to confirm 6 transactions were made also at local corner stores, some  purchases were made TWICE at the same corner store on the same card.

All the purchases are between 85$ and 98$ (PAYPASS probably trying to keep the limit below 100$)

I  have personally called some of these corner stores to inform them that  purchases were made there with stolen cards and have made an official  file and declaration with the police.

It  seems rather peculiar that someone can spend over 800$ at different gas  stations / corner stores within an hour or so what type of purchases  are most likely made? Gas? 800 Liters of gas? I'm looking to pick you  guy's smart brains and see if I can help these stores and the police  with any clues to look for, I especially would like these types of  people to get caught and not get away with it.

Since  all these transactions (Total of 8) were made within stores(5-6 stores)  that probably all have camera surveillance and I have most of the  ""timestamps"" on the transctions + the police is involved, has anyone  ever had any luck catching thieves by going through this process?

Planning for stability of long-term accounts (TFSA/RRSP),"Exhibit A (LBC HISA): https://i.imgur.com/tMwsNMR.png Really makes you feel like a sucker for chasing the best rate. However since it's a non-registered cash account, it's relatively painless to move money somewhere else.

Going to use fictional numbers for a friends situation.

Right now they currently have \~$10K of debt sitting on a credit card at around 20% interest. However, they also have around $12K in an RRSP in some poor investments.

I'd like to recommend that they pull the money out of their RRSP (pay tax on it), and pay down the credit card debt.

This would leave them with some schooling debt at a much lower rate which can be dealt with over time.

What are people investing in these days in the RESP glide path’s later years?,"Any thoughts on what to do for the fixed income portion in later years (e.g. age 13+, or less than 5 years from start of school for the beneficiary)? After last March’s “liquidity crisis” I’m feeling a bit less confident in using a bond universe fund (eg ZAG) to provide stable capital preservation. But, the GIC rates I see available in Questrade’s bonds bulletin suck horribly (not even beating inflation) and HISA promotional rates don’t seem to exist for RESPs (even if they did, they also don’t allow for easy rebalancing with a brokerage held account without slow transfers with associated fees across providers).

Would a short term / ultra short term bond fund be better/ less risky than ZAG/VAB? (E.g., VSB / ZST) Or maybe one of the HISA ETFs (CSAV, PSA), although these don’t seem much better than the 1-year GIC rates...

Questions regarding SIN,"So in my last name it consists of my mother’s maiden name as well as my father’s last name. So I have basically have 2 last names. My problem is on my mom’s maiden name there is a spelling error in which a letter is missing. 

For example it should be “ABCD” but on my SIN card its only “ABD” so the one letter is omitted. I think this happened when my parents filed the paperwork back then when getting our SIN and they must have made a mistake. However in all my other IDs such as driver’s license I have it spelled correctly.

Now I want to fix this and have a couple of questions regarding on how to do this.

1. How do I go about this? Do I call CRA or go to a Service Canada/Ontario?

2. If it ends up being corrected, do I keep the same social insurance number? Or am I assigned a new number?

3. I read in some posts that they don’t issue SIN cards anymore, is this true? If it is, what do you use now as ID when asked for SIN? 

4. My bank account at TD also has this spelling error, if it ends up getting fixed do I simply make them update my name or will they have to make a whole new account?

TIA for any information and sorry if any of these questions are dumb, but I’m just looking for guidance.",4,1609715620.0,2021,2021-01-03,,enigmatic_jc,1,kpviez
Investment advice needed,"( New account for privacy reason, :) )

Happy new year PFC!  
32M, I have a family of 3, live in a townhome in GVA bought in 2018, the housing price tanked for around 60k (bc assessment price) since we bought it. Family income is >250k, TFSA and RSP are all maxed out and invested in ETFs like VGRO. No debts except mortgage.

We just sold a rental property we previously lived in before moved to BC. The gain plus our saving is around 400k. Now I'm thinking about how to deal with the money:

  
1. Use it as downpay to buy a single detached home and rent out the current townhome, since we want to move to a detached home eventually. The CON apparently is a bigger mortgage and higher living cost, while the current townhome is big enough for a family of 4 down the road and it's not a good investment if rented out. I don't want to sell the townhome now to get a loss.  


2. Invest 400k in VRGO in unregistered account. Since this amount is big to us, I'm gonna split and invest 40k every month to flatten the buy-in price, which will take 10 months to finish the whole thing.  


3. Invest 200k in VRGO in unregistered account like above, and then use 200k to buy an rental property and hold it long term. I only want to buy a single detached house, no need to deal with strata and insurance premium increases. Kelowna is a preferred location, and we could potentially live in it after retirement.

&#x200B;

I think choice 1) is not financially optimal compared to the other two, and leaning towards to go with choice 3). Any suggestions?",13,1609715461.0,2021,2021-01-03,,random20201212,0,kpvgm4
"23, sitting on 64K - should I pay off my OSAP or purchase my first investment property?","Hi everyone! I'm 23 years old, graduated from university and have been working for about a year and half. 

I have roughly $64,000 in total assets and I'm sitting on an OSAP student loan of about 24,00k. I have minimal credit card debt - everything is paid off and my spending is managed well.

The majority of the 64k is sitting in TFSAs and RRSPs (some mutual funds, some managed individually).   I bought a ton of long term stocks earlier this year when markets were down due to COVID - Apple, Tesla, AMEX, Shopify, that kind of stuff. 

I have about 17k in cash at the moment and I'm planning on hopefully being able to put money down on my first investment property before 2021. (likely reconstruction in Cambridge or something). 

**I wanted to get opinions and thoughts on whether or not I should go ahead and work towards investing in a property this year while still making monthly OSAP payments (they're about 350 monthly which is manageable for me) or if I should fast track and pay off my loan which I'd be able to do before 2021.**

TD1 - Multiple Employers Advice,"Hi,

I see on the work portal for my part-time job that there is a section for tax withholding for federal and provincial where on the tax credits it shows the basic personal amounts so I guess they assumed...Does this mean that it has already been claimed for my part-time job?

If so, should I check the box ""More than one employer or payer at the same time"" and put in 0 for my full-time job? I've seen some comments say that we should claim deductions for the job that we earn more money on and update the TD1 form for the part-time job... just making sure that's right.

I am a novice to investing. Looking for advice/options on where and how to start.,"Hi folks, this is my situation:

I (31M) am a healthcare worker who is also an independent contractor. I work full-time with all of my pay being given to me in gross. As such, I put 30% of each paycheque away in a TFSA to set it aside to pay back what I owe at tax time.

I have recently (FINALLY) paid off the last of my student loans to the NSLSC, and this is the first time that I have most of my income going into a savings account without needing to worry about paying anything off other than my car financing. I am living comfortably and am looking to make my first steps towards investing as I don't want all of my savings sitting as cash.

I am a novice to investing and have not previously been educated on my options other than what I hear at family get-togethers (pre-pandemic, of course!) and colloquial advice from friends (who still live with parents). I do have an RRSP/mutual fund that I am adding to on a monthly basis and my SO and I have enough saved to soon purchase our first home, but we are in no rush.

Are there any vehicles or methods for investing that would be recommended to someone in my position? I've read about services like Wealthsimple or Questrade, and I have also considered consulting an investment broker but again, don't know where to start.

My nieces are in college and looking for some recommendations on personal finance reading. I've sent them a few YouTube videos, I've sent them my personal favorites which are the Gail Vaz Oxlade books, but nothing is ""speaking"" to them. I think the Gail books didn't really appeal to them because my brother and sister-in-law are very against what she teaches. It's usually a fun dinner time argument.

Any suggestions for personal finance books that capture the attention of Gen Z  folks?

Young adult in need of advice on where to begin with investing...,"I (23F) just started working full time after graduating in August. I want to learn more about personal finances and investing but it all seems so overwhelming. I don’t really have anyone close to me who is knowledgeable on the topic and can help explain things to me. 

I would really appreciate any books or websites or YouTube channels that could help me explain the different types of investing options available. I know the Wealthy Barber is a popular one, however I know it focuses on US investing so I’d like something similar for us Canadians. It’s just so hard to know how much of my paycheque I should invest and what to invest in based on my goals (see below). 

In terms of what I want to invest and save for, I’d like it to be for both retirement and eventually a down payment for a house. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!",4,1609694789.0,2021,2021-01-03,Investing,sunflowr13,0,kpol04

Not Keeping Up with The Joneses- or How I just avoided the lifestyle creep trap,"Long post alert. This is more of a self-reflection than anything, maybe a little humble brag, and perhaps food for thought for anyone in a similar situation. These are things I can't really share with anyone besides my partner.

I (33,M) live in Toronto with my partner, in a \~550 sq ft 1BR in a 'highly desirable' (using RE lingo) area, in an older low-rise purpose-built rental. I started renting this place in 2017 when rents were slightly lower (by Toronto standards) and has gone up very little in 3 years. We pay just north of $1500 - including 2 parking spots and a storage space. Anyone in the GTA can tell you how good of a deal this is. Of that I pay about 61% because my income is significantly higher. All in all, only\~18% of my take home pay goes towards rent.

Recently, rents for 1 and 2 BR places across the GTA have dropped significantly. So have the RE prices. So much so that about a month ago I seriously started thinking about moving into a bigger space, even though the net rent will be at least $300-400 higher. I figured we can easily afford it, even if my partner doesn't spend a penny more in her share, because it'd still be <30% of my take home. I almost pulled the trigger on contacting an RE agent to find a place, but one evening my partner and I sat down and talked about what we really want. Turns out all I wanted was some space to set up a proper home office. In my head I couldn't imagine carving out more space in the current place but it wasn't actually that hard if we were willing to let go of some possessions. We decided we will re-do our space. 

Cut to couple of days later, we completely revamped our 550 sq ft place, got rid of some older furniture that was taking up space, ordered some more functional furniture including home office stuff, re-arranged closets, and now for <$1000, this place looks completely different, with ample space for a home office set-up. We plan to make even more efficient changes with time. Props to my partner for initiating the bulk of this work.

On Dec 31, I did my 2021 budget projections. Turns out, after all fixed expenses, saving a minimum of $2k/month, I personally will still be left with >$500 each month. If I did move, that extra 500 could easily get consumed, AND I'd probably be spending more on furniture anyway.

This whole exercise made me realize that a lot of the desire to move into bigger and bigger spaces probably comes from social norms/pressures. We tend to acquire things that we don't really need, but feel like it will make us happy if we get them. I realized it can be hard to let go of possessions, but it can be freeing. What if I just stop caring about the traditional way of doing things, i.e. keep living larger and larger as my income grows? Just because I can afford something doesn't mean I really need it. What if I only possess things that truly make me happy. If I have friends and family that judge me for it, do I really need them?  


Don't assume I am some kind of monk. for example, I grew up very very middle class in a 3rd world country, and I really really understand the value of money. With no family in Canada, and virtually no inheritance to count on, it gives me immense peace of mind to know that I have a significant safety cushion to fall back on. In 2021, assuming no MAJOR market crashes, I am on track to cross the $100K mark in savings+investments (a personal milestone). I started seriously saving Q4-2017. will be buying out my leased car (don't ask! early career mistake) next year cash.  
\[There was a whole episode of considering buying a condo in there but that's for another time\]

**So TL;DR:** Almost moved to higher rent place because I could afford it and thought that's what I needed, but realized I can have all I wanted in my current space with a little re-imagination, thus saving thousands.",208,1609693929.0,2021,2021-01-03,,rdmajumdar13,590,kpob4l

Are there any ways to improve your credit other than waiting the 10 years for past collections to drop off?,"I've paid my collections recently and unknowingly restarted the 6 year clock.

"Lender hit by covid, need to move closing date - options?","I am buying a house in Ontario worth 600k, have about 35% for downpayment. Offer made and accepted a month ago after consultation with the mortgage broker. It was decided to have the closing on Jan 8, 2021. Got a call from mortgage broker around New Year's Day that the lender's office is bogged down because some employees have covid. They can't make the Jan 8th date anymore. Spoke to a number of other lenders, they all say 2-3 weeks to close (Jan 15th earliest) and won't touch the Jan 8th date. Went back to the seller to find out if they are willing to move the closing. They raised a number of obvious issues like utilities are cancelled, house insurance is stopped, legal and real estate paperwork being filed, etc. Nothing earth-shattering, but they are pushing back for me to find ""another solution"". Does anyone have any ideas? 

So far options are:

1. Come up with all-cash (390k) through the magic of begging family and friends.
2. Move the closing date and cover all costs related to doing so (offered - owner not receptive).
3. Set-up a promissory note of some kind with a lien on the house so the homeowner gets downpayment on Jan 8th, with remainder showing up when mortgage is granted Jan 15th.
4. Discover a miraculous lender who can close in 5 days.
5. Let the contract fail on closing day and argue about deposit (Jan 8th).

"Young newbie opened a TFSA, how should I grow it?","18-year old beginner here,

on my birthday in December, I went to TD, opened up a TFSA, and put the maximum in. Woo, savings!

I have an intense interest in finance, which my Dad supports by providing books (currently going through *Talk Money to Me* by Kelley Keehn, and *The Economics Book*. Beginner stuff, I know). I am also planning to study some form of finance at university (a whole other big decision), meaning that by September, I will be living off my RESP and part-time earnings.

I don't see myself drawing out of the TFSA for at least 5 years, which has led Dad and I to the conclusion that I should invest it aggressively now, while the market is what it is. Now, Dad has always been more of a hands-off collector (due to having the luck to get in with a giant early), with the belief that most things will grow if you are patient.

Dad is having me look at TD mutual funds, which do look safe and rewarding; but because I am a headstrong and eager teenager, I am hesitant to be passive with my first investments. What are your two cents?

**TLD;DR. Opened up a TFSA on my 18th, going to take the opportunity to invest.

Insurance Policies Through Mortgage - is it common to take these?,"Hi all,

My partner and I are finalizing refinancing our mortgage, and trying to decide which insurances to be covered for. 

I’m just trying to get an idea how common it is to be covered by your mortgage in each of these categories (life, critical illness, disability, and job loss).

Or are we just being fleeced?  To have full coverage for both of us would be almost $200 extra bi-weekly.

We’re early 30s and each have some coverage through our work for most of these, my partner more than me.   Is it a good idea to have this extra coverage or are we better off putting our money elsewhere?

Looking for suggestions on how to better get my finances in order with a different bank that is not online or out of province.

Hoping......or was wondering if I'm able to carry this balance over to a different bank, preferably a bank that I can walk into vice online dealings. 

My reasoning....If I can get a lower interest rate and an interest free 1yr sort of thing, this will help me clear the balance quicker as opposed to just paying interest.

"Would a plethora of ""hotel-like amenities"" in a condo dramatically increase strata fees?","I'm currently renting in Vancouver. My partner wants to move into one of the newest condos in Greater Vancouver, but keeps picking the ones with ""hotel-like amenities"", including:

- fitness centre and yoga centre

- social lounge with gourmet kitchen and dining room

Saw the EQ TFSA 2.3% promo a while back and finally decided to hop on it on Jan 1, 2021.  I filed taxes as a non-resident for 2018 and 2019 (was working abroad with a working visa).  Came back to Canada in April 2020 b/c of corona, and have been here since so I guess I will be considered a Canadian resident for the year of 2020.

I am still hoping to leave Canada once things clear up/looking for jobs abroad (not expecting anything till April earliest), but by doing so, will I end up being considered as a non-resident and will therefore have contributed into my TFSA as a non-resident?  

What are my options to go from here?  Should I just stay the 183 days (again corona may end up causing this) or should I withdraw my money ASAP (what are the consequences)?  Can I file my taxes as a resident even if I'm not in Canada for the 183 days?

Are you charged the full HST for $30k revenue?,"Say your income for freelancing gigs was $29k for up to November of 2020. That means you haven't registered your  business  yet because it's under $30k, hence you didn't collect any HST.

But then you find out that you will receive an additional $1k in revenue in December. That would put you at $30k. So you register your business and collect the HST(from the client) for the additional $1k revenue.

Now does that mean for taxes you only pay the HST you collected or do you have to pay the full HST based on the $30k revenue?

Also what if your revenue is under $30k for the following year, do you still have to charge HST to clients or is that optional?",3,1609657054.0,2021,2021-01-03,Taxes,snapekilledyomomma,4,kpfurl
"Comfortably buy Strata Townhome, or try to Extend for Worse Build Freehold?","Hi All,

I've been actively looking at the market in my area and I am within the range of comfortably affording a strata townhome or I could stretch for a freehold. A solid strata with 3 bed 2.5 bath would cost around high 300s to low 400s where I am at. Strata fees sitting at 300-400/month, but that covers water, grass, snow, driveway, insurance.

A freehold with a worse build (3 bed, 1.5 bath) would be around 450 to 500k. Some stratas have finished basements with full washrooms, opening up the potential to rent.

Right now my maximum possible affordability is close to around 500k. I earn 62,000 a year in a permanent government job and have been preapproved for 360,000 in mortgage for a 30 year amort, or 300,000 if I go for a 25 year amort.

Down payment on hand is about 100k. I can stretch this to 130k by not paying my student loans back in full immediately, and the parents are willing to lend another 50k to make it 180k. That would bring my purchasing power to almost 500k, give or take a few. But I'm not comfortable with having so much debt to pay down ...

A freehold is within range, but I fear that if anything goes wrong, it would ruin me. Something like a leaky roof, furnace problems, or even something like me getting hit by a car would be the end. But on the other hand, a freehold would appreciate much faster compared to a similar strata.

What are your thoughts on this? Cheers and happy new year!",7,1609656502.0,2021,2021-01-03,Estate,Cheap_Lingonberry_74,0,kpfqe9
XINC vs XEQT,"New to PFC, trying to figure out how to invest my savings with my TFSA, RRSP and Cash account. 

I was wondering if someone can explain to me why XEQT is better for the long run than XINC. I understand that one is 100% equity vs 80% bonds and 20% equity. 

I'm looking at this [https://cdn.canadianportfoliomanagerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Model-ETF-Portfolios-iShares-2020-09-30-Light-2.pdf](https://cdn.canadianportfoliomanagerblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Model-ETF-Portfolios-iShares-2020-09-30-Light-2.pdf) and it shows that for the 5 year annualized its return for XINC is 5% compared to XEQT's 9% which is a significant difference but XEQT also has a much greater risk with the lowest annual return being -33% compared to -5%. to me the extra 4% might not be worth the riskiness of an annual return of -33% compared to -5%. The 20 year annualized and 25 year annualized has XINC with a higher annual return. Looking at this wouldn't it be better to have XINC if your time horizon is greater than 20 years. However I always see people recommending XEQT for a long time frame. 

I don't plan on touching my RRSP until I retire so that has a long time horizon, I'd like to purchase a property in the next 5 years (can be flexible). So for those reasons, I was thinking it makes sense to invest my RRSP in something riskier like all equities but invest my TFSA and remaining cash in something like VCIP. However, this chart is confusing to me when looking at the annualized returns for the different time periods.",6,1609655517.0,2021,2021-01-03,,Pretend_Ad2724,0,kpfhkx

Maxed out TFSA... real estate? RSP?,"Hello,

I have looked through a number of similar posts to this one. Have not really gotten anywhere and I was hoping that maybe if I posted myself I could get some more tailored and perhaps helpful advice to others given the current market climate.

For a little background context I am a 23 year old, working full time and living at home. I wanted to get a little more bang for my buck so I started looking into ways to do so. I have a safety fund, in a HISA, with 6 months worth of potential expenses if I moved out during covid and had to rent. In addition I maxed out my TFSA in XGRO.

I am about to take on a new job where my salary will pretty much double. My tax bracket will increase tremendously, which makes me hesitant to contribute to my RSP before I start that job. It will not make much of a difference regardless since my tax return is maxed from school this year. However even upon starting that job due to my age and income projection I am worried I may want that contribution room later on in life?

Real estate is something that seems perhaps a good investment (assuming I’m not living there since it would be an expense) but I am unsure about that as well.

Individual stocks/crypto is another potential path forward but quite a risky one and capital gains could be huge if not held in a RSP.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated !!",12,1609653775.0,2021,2021-01-03,,throwaway_tfsa_121,0,kpf22z

My sister in-law has stocks in her company which went public on the Norwegian exchange. There is a buyback program in which vested shares can be sold to the company and then given to her as income.

What's my TFSA contribution room,"Hey everyone, I'm wondering if someone can tell me what the correct number is for my tfsa contribution room. I'm 21 years old born in 99' - thus I believe I have $29000 in contribution inherently.

What I'm confused about is when it comes to contributions/withdrawals and how it adds up. I moved shares in and out of my tfsa as I was (incorrectly) advised that I can't grow over the limit without paying a fee.

Here's my chronological history of contributions/withdrawals. Positives are contributions, negatives are withdraws. I don't believe currency makes any difference - just CAD equivalent - but I've marked what transitions were in USD incase I'm mistaken. All numeric values are converted into CAD at the date they were made

&#x200B;

2019:

$10085 - cash (cad) deposit

&#x200B;

CRA contribution room for the following year --  $12915

&#x200B;

2020:

&#x200B;

\-$758 - stock withdraw

\-$2932.50 - stock withdraw

$608.43 - stock deposit

$2600.84 - stock deposit

$1000 - cash (cad) deposit

\-$17014.8 - cash (usd) withdraw

$10883.20 - cash (usd) deposit

\-$1356.2 - cash (usd) withdraw

\-$4035.40 - cash (usd) withdraw

\-$443.93 - cash (cad) withdraw

&#x200B;

The number from the CRA page say's my contribution room 2021 is $18915, is this correct or did they just add the $6000 to the previous years and will update later? If you sum my entire contr & withdraws it's -$1361.14. Does that mean I have 30364.14 in room?

&#x200B;

Note: I understand that if withdraws aren't added until the end of a calendar year,  I went over my contribution room for 2020 and I'll likely pay the 1%/month penalty on the overage deposits.

If I had already reached my rrsp limit for 2020, can I still contribute some amount between January to March of 2021 that would count towards my 2021 rrsp limit before I file the tax return with CRA ? Or do I get the rrsp contribution room for 2021 only after I file taxes? 

I calculated (roughly) my rrsp limit for 2021 based on my income from 2020, so I wouldn’t over contribute for 2021, but am I allowed to contribute that amount now before I even file taxes for 2020?

Context:

\- Canadian Citizen 

\- Graduating in 2021

\- Have roughly 100k CAD sitting in HISA across multiple accounts (made from internships throughout university)

\- I currently plan on eventually returning to Canada in 5-10 years

\- Paying off all of my student loans

\- Not opening a TFSA given that the IRS does not grant tax-deferred status to the Canadian TFSA

\- Opening up an RRSP and maxing that out. I'm planning on maybe starting with a RoboAdvisor or self-directed with XGRO or VGRO.

\- Transferring some money to USD to help with expenses in the US (maybe around 10k)

\- Leaving the rest in an HISA in Canada

Non-real estate leveraged investment options,"One of the main points in many ""buy vs rent"" articles comes down to comparing returns on real estate vs. opportunity cost of not investing money in the stock market. What is not usually explicitly mentioned however is the huge leverage you get as a homeowner with mortgage that can multiply your returns, whereas leverage in the stock marker is usually seen as a bad and risky thing.

From what I know three main ways how to have leverage in the stock market are - (1) margin account, (2) leveraged ETF, (3) derivatives. None of these really approximate mortgage as a ""safe"" and ""socially acceptable"" long-term leverage strategy.

So my question is - if you got convinced by ""rent"" argument and decided to stay away from owning real estate, how do you get comparable leverage?",7,1609628443.0,2021,2021-01-02,Investing,b-stone,4,kp7ww3

Scotia STEP Mortgage on Rental Condo - Considering Smith Maneuver,"Happy New Year all! I am a DIY investor with beginner knowledge, so I hope I've got my terminology and concepts bedded down. I am considering the Smith Manuever for an investment strategy, but am having some difficulty piecing together some key aspects to determine feasibility and would also like validation on my understanding... Help!

I have a fixed rate mortgage with Scotia STEP at 3.25% for a rental condo in the GTA which has approx. 110k mortgage balance left and the term is up for renewal in 2022; mortgage interest is currently claimed against rental income where after other expenses (i.e. property tax, maintenance, insurance) I come up *slightly* cashflow positive. The mortgage has provided me with approx. 90k available credit I can use for another STEP product, and with this interest rate climate I was thinking to sign up for a STEP product to employ the Smith Maneuver for investing in a non-registered account. I am very fortunate and thankful to have this rental income that provides some flexibility, have steady employment income, maxed out my TFSA and RRSP (also have a LIRA), have emergency funds for my personal expenses and another for my rental property, no non-registered accounts, do not carry any debt other than my mortgage and misc. credit card expenses of approx. 1k/mo. I am unmarried (I care most about the marriage/relationship and am quite private/shy, so when my time comes I'm planning something small and intimate rather than some money pit production) with no kids (would like 1-2) and am looking forward to these two things materializing in the next 5 years, do not own my principal residence (current housing will suffice  with upcoming life events so I am not eager to buy a property unless absolutely needed), have at least 20-30 years to go in my investment horizon (I generally like a set-and-forget/passive approach where possible) and am comfortable with taking some investment risk (my risk profile is set to high for my registered accounts, but I would say it is moderate otherwise, and probably low for debt).

I would like get your opinion in the following:

\- is it a wise strategy to use the Smith Maneuver on the rental property, or even at all, given my details? I do not intend to maximize all the credit available to me from the Scotia STEP unless there is a very compelling reason to take on that much debt.

\- would I be able to claim interest on both the mortgage and the loan from one of the STEP products to obtain a loan to invest in the stock market on my tax return, given I am already claiming the mortgage interest?

\- which is the best STEP product to use?  I see Scotia offers a personal credit and personal loan, I don't understand the difference between either - I have been trying to get a hold of the associate at Scotia who supposedly is looking after my account, but they have been MIA - tried to get basic info on the products, interest rates, and other terms.

\- my marginal tax rate is  43.41%; what kinds of holdings should I keep in the non-registered account funded by the loan? I know the investments have to have some reasonable expectation of producing income and understand that Canadian dividend stocks would be the most tax advantageous, however, I read somewhere that because I am in the higher range of tax brackets, that dividend investing might not be so advantageous. Any specific suggestions/picks are helpful too! A very specific holdings question in line with the dividend investing, I currently hold HHL.TO in my TFSA; since it has a high dividend, am I better to sell it from the TFSA, keep the sale proceeds in TFSA and purchase another ETF (e.g. VEQT, which I already hold) and repurchase HHL.TO in this non-registered account?

\- if I decide to sell holdings from the non-registered account which is funded by the loan, am I correct in understanding that the proceeds from the sale have do not necessarily have to be used for further ""income producing"" activities (i.e. investing in the market again, strictly contribute to paying down mortgage on rental property) and that it could be put towards funding personal expenses? Reason for the clarification is that I was told it sometimes makes little sense to pay down the rental mortgage especially when rates are low due to opportunity cost on better earning potential for other investment types - since rental mortgage is covered by rental income, thereby increasing credit available in STEP product, seems there is little incentive to make additional payments to the mortgage.

I hope to hear from you! I am trying to be as comprehensive as possible; if you think there are any other factors missing (that you you need from me before providing your insight, I intentionally left out some specifics/numbers), or considerations I need to account for when taking your advice/suggestions, please let me know - would be very helpful!",2,1609626938.0,2021,2021-01-02,Investing,SaidTheInquirer,7,kp7fqe

Using excel formulas to calculate accurate rate of return,"Happy New Year everyone!

I have some questions about excel formulas for tracking investment rate of return. What I would like to do is calculate an accurate rate of return for each account and then use those to calculate the ROR for the whole portfolio.

I have 6 accounts: 1 TFSA, and 3 RRSP accounts. Right now, I am only contributing to the TFSA and one of the CAD RRSP accounts (had to setup a separate one for my job RRSP matching program). I have a separate worksheet for each account, but they are all within the same workbook.

Here are my questions:

1. One of the accounts is a locked-in RRSP that I transferred my military pension into after leaving 4 years ago. I have not been contributed to this since. What is the best method for calculating the ROR? IRR, XIRR, etc?
2. Two of my RRSP accounts have Canadian dollar and US dollar components. If I transfer funds from the Canadian to US (or vice-versa), how do I track the rate of return? Do I convert the account back to CAD and then find the ROR or do I use the USD form?
3. When calculating the aggregate ROR for all the accounts, I was going to use a weighted percentage using the ending account balance, the total portfolio balance, and the account ROR. Is the formula below the correct way to do this?

* Example: Overall ROR = (Acc #1 Balance / Total Portfolio)\*(Acc #1 ROR) + (Acc #2 Balance / Total Portfolio)\*(Acc #2 ROR)

In each of the lines, there exists a point that corresponds to a perfect global-market-proportional allocation. And that point should have (at least roughly) the same risk and return for all lines.

Diagnosed with a Disability that might require me to stop work before retirement age.,"I'm from Toronto, Ontario, in my early 30s and I was recently diagnosed with a neurological movement disorder. Because of this I may need to stop working before retirement age. 

I have long term disability insurance through work, amazing benefits and a good pension but am a public service worker and have been on a wage freeze for years now (nearly a decade if I remember correctly). I do not plan on changing employers because of the benefits. 

I would like to start putting money away in case I need to stop working early as a result of my disability. I looked into disability savings bonds, but you need to be eligible for the Canada Disability Tax Credit (which I am not as I am still functional) also they are more geared towards parents saving for their disabled child for after they die. 

I have a 3 month emergency fund the EQ bank TSFA and I started a WealthSimple account for long term investments but have no contributed to it yet. 

I have some extra money right now from working from home and not being able to go out to socialize. I was wondering where you guys think I should put it to maximize returns. 

The EQ bank TSFA has a 2.3% interest rate (although I'm not sure how long they'll offer this) and I have more contribution room than I'll probably ever be able to fill. I would like to start putting a little of my surplus income into my RRSPs but that's a little lower on the priority list due to my pension (but I still want to start contributing now- the younger the better!) 

As of right now I'm thinking of upping my emergency fund to 6 months of expenses (which will take a few more months) and after that putting maybe 10% of my surplus into RRSPs and the rest in WealthSimple. 

Can you think of any other products or services, grants, or bonds that would be helpful to me? Do you know of anything specific to saving for future disabilities? Any and all suggestions welcome! Thanks!!",12,1609617763.0,2021,2021-01-02,Investing,mortuusanima,3,kp4j7y

Taxes on Stocks do I got this right,"1. Inside a TFSA, income created from dividends and capital gains are not taxed at all except if it is a USA Stock that pays out a Dividend you have a withholding tax of 30% that can go down to 15% with the correct form
2. Inside a RRSP you are not taxed ""right now"" until you withdraw the gains at a future date but the whole idea here is to withdraw when you are retired and are in a lower tax bracket due to income (deferred)
3.  **non**\-**registered investment account**  is where I am a bit on the lost side of things.  I understand it is more flexible and there are no tax benefits.  What I am having a bit of problems with is when you pay taxes.  I understand that Canada taxes Capital Gains of 50% when you sell a stock and that is added to your income and then the overall tax depends on your marginal rate from your total income.   
\- What I am not clear on is if you do not sell.  Like If I bought 100 shares of Company ABC and during the year that stock gave me 5000 in capital gains, however I do not sell it.  Does that stock need to be reported on my income tax for that year or is the stock only taxed when I actually sell it?  I do also understand if you have a capital loss you can put it towards gains to help balance things out or carry it over for up to the next 3 years I believe?",8,1609616618.0,2021,2021-01-02,Taxes,DarkZodiacMCOC,0,kp45rs

Concerned about parents' ability to retire while also wanting to buy 1st house.,"Hi PFC,

Throwaway for privacy reasons.

My parents are about to retire soon. My sibling and I (both mid-20s) still live together with my parents. We have always rented our whole lives but now they want to purchase their first property (whether it be a condo, townhouse, etc. they just want a place for the family). However, I have serious concerns about the future:

* My parents being low-skilled immigrants have no chance of getting a mortgage due to their low earnings, so they want me and my sibling to ideally jointly get a mortgage for a property. I originally had no desire of owning property, but my parents are *adamant* about it. I am open to the idea of purchasing property and then have my brother and I contribute to the payments.
* My parents have a combined life savings of $200K - and it's simply just sitting in normal chequing/savings accounts. I am worried about their ability to retire, especially since we live in a rather high COL city.
* I have just entered the workforce full-time with a salary of just $40K. My sibling doesn't earn more than I do. We may eventually have to take care of our parents as they grow older because I'm not sure if my parents' savings are enough.

I have just started taking personal finance seriously (kinda late, I know), so I am not super knowledgeable - but I have been lurking on this subreddit for a bit to learn as much as I can. After looking at all the numbers, I simply don't know how feasible my parents' ambitions are. I'm the elder sibling in the family (also with the most earning potential as I'm the only one in the family with post-secondary education), so there is more responsibility put on me to 'look after the family'. We obviously do not have the ability right now to purchase property. But given that I progress in my career and earn more, they would want us to purchase a place for the family. My sibling and I had thoughts of moving out in the future but have doubts about this now. 

Is it even possible to purchase property in our situation? Will we have to rent for the rest of our lives? Will my parents be able to retire with their savings?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.",13,1609613286.0,2021,2021-01-02,,crisperwhisper,0,kp322t
Just started my career and overwhelmed with how to manage my money,"Hi personal finance Canada,

Other than that I pay $400 a month in rent. I’m generally quite frugal and enjoy saving but I never know what to do with the savings I have.

"New Grads, What Are you Currently Saving Up for?","I [22 y/o] know its really important to save your money, pay off your debt and having enough to cover living expenses before considering investments (as per the PFC rules). I recently graduated and will start work in January. I've been trying to get better with learning about my finances.

I have been lucky enough to have internships to earn money, and have been able to pay off my student debt. for at least the next 12 months, i'll be working from home at my parents home, so it'll give me even more chance to save on certain expenses throughout the year, compared to living on my own.

Anyways, I'd like to save up my money, in a TFSA, and eventually open an ETF when i have earned a bit more. But for now, I'd like to start off small with the TFSA. But I'm wondering; I don't have many expenses, I paid off my student debt, I don't plan to make large investments (car, property) in the next year. So what is the common purpose for early 20s people to save their money for ? Is it okay for that to be investments into an ETF or future travel plans or moving out expenses after 12 months?

How are AMEX Cobalt vs bank credit cards?,"\*\*\* AMEX Cobalt \*\*\*

The 5pts-earning-places in Ontario look good for the places that I go to; how are the redemptions?

Are the individually-owned restaurants classified in the 1x or 5x category? Any weird big-name stores that don't take AMEX?

Say I can earn 30,000-34,000 points a year. I saw their fixed-point flight chart, but I don't really trust those estimates. With the first year bonus, say 62,000-66,000pts in my first year. Can anyone give an example of a merchandise redemption (idk pick some popular electronic) and a flight redemption? I don't intend on using pts to pay the balance, plus that's been calculated by people on the internet already.

\*\*\* EDIT \*\*\*

Does anyone know if you can apply Aeroplan point collection to a flight you redeemed through Amex points? I doubt it but that would be such a nice hack...

\*\*\* Comparison vs banks \*\*\*

The main redemption/perks I'm looking for are travel; I tend to rack up my points as I spend for a year or two, then redeem them to dress up my ""average"" trip to a ""nice"" trip with whatever perks I can get. Given that, how does the cobalt compare? In decreasing order of preference as of now:

* Amex Cobalt ($120)
   * 5x pts on restaurants and some groceries, so I expect to rack points like crazy this way
   * 32,500 promo points available
   * Proprietary pts not preferred; not sure how good redemption rate on this is
* TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite ($139)
   * I heard Aeroplan redemption is nice; plus its part of star alliance
   * 2x pts on Aeroplan partners although idk who those are
   * 1.5x pts on groceries, but misses my other big category of restaurants
   * 1st year fee waived + 10,000 promo pts available
* Scotiabank Passport Visa Infinite ($139)
   * 2x pts on groceries and restaurants, my biggest spending category
   * Proprietary pts not preferred; not sure how good redemption rate on this is
   * 30,000 promo pts available (10,000 are probably not achievable as it requires $40k spending)
   * Lounge access a very nice plus (6 visits) + no foreign exch fee so if I actually travel it'll help?
* CIBC Aventura Visa Infinite ($120)

Held off because I did not understand it well, but I did a lot of research in the past 2 months and I feel like I am prepared to put my money where my mouth is now. I have a stable job and an emergency fund along with index funds (100% VGRO) so I am pretty sure I can gamble a small percentage of my portfolio with Bitcoin.  
 
Was thinking about investing in QBTC since it can be stored in a TFSA, but I heard that this is not really true Bitcoin. Looked at WealthSimple and that looks super expensive and it can only be invested in a non-registered taxable account. Should I just pull the trigger, get into the game now, and buy some QBTC since we just got TFSA contribution room increased by another 6k?

Tax Return as an Independent Contractor,"About a month ago I took a job as an independent contractor.  As part of the contract I had to set myself up as a corporation.  I'm paid a set hourly rate, I'm guaranteed full time hours for the next 11 months, and I'm paid every two weeks.  I'm also paid HST on top of my hours; which of course I'll be remitting to the CRA.

Are there any contract workers here?  What do you use to do your taxes? I'm considering using an online product to do my tax return, as I don't think my situation is a complicated one; I can pretty easily ballpark my annual income (sales) based on the hours I'm guaranteed and my hourly rate.  Although maybe I should hire an accountant.  For the people who have done contract work what did you do?

Another question I have is:

Since I'm paying myself as an employee of my corporation do I need to pay Ontario / federal income tax on top of my corporate taxes? or do I just pay my corporate taxes?

Any reason to tag with RBC?,"I currently use RBC for my banking. I have a:
-	Signature No Limit Chequing account
-	Day to day banking Savings account
-	High interest Esavings account 

I’m paid weekly and my cash flow works like this: 
1.	My pay is deposited into the chequing account. 
2.	I then put about half into the savings account for monthly expenses like rent and child support. 
3.	I put a small amount into the HISA and about 10% goes to a TFSA I have with Questrade. 
4.	The remainder goes to a cash back MasterCard which I use for nearly all my daily spending (I never pay interest on this). 

I was looking at comparisons of HISA’s online and it looks like there is no comparison. RBC offers a tiny interest rate compared to EQ bank or Tangerine. Am I missing something? Is there a reason to stick with RBC given my fairly simple banking needs or should I be looking at moving my accounts to EQ?

Questions on Reporting a Home Sale to the CRA,"In 2013, a family member and I purchased a house in Ontario. It was where I lived until the home was sold in 2019 and so it qualifies for the principal residence exemption. However, the family member made some terrible financial and business decisions through the years so we had the home refinanced in 2017 to pay down some other debt.

I'm about to file my 2019 tax return through TurboTax and I'm aware that there will probably be a late filing penalty because of the home sale and principal residence exemption. I understand I should split the adjusted cost base and proceeds of disposition in half because of the two names on the mortgage but should I be using the original 2013 numbers for the adjusted cost base or the 2017 numbers to reflect the higher mortgage balance?

TurboTax help states that ""the taxpayer's acquisition date with respect to the property is ... the date on which the taxpayer last acquired or reacquired the property, or is deemed to have last acquired or reacquired it.""

Age 25 & I need better finance strategies in 2021,"Hi Everyone, 

I haven’t made the best financial decisions this year. I have lost my job last year due to Covid issues and now I have been working for 3 months as a BDR in a company that only pays 30k base salary with commissions. 

This past year I’ve been in and out of work and finally feel like I’ve found something secure. 

I’m currently working on my real estate license and have a few courses left to complete. 

Everything has taken a hit this past year, I haven’t been able to save a lot because my income, my computer & phone broke so I decided to buy a new and slightly expensive ones and I also made bad investments and losing money on some of them. 

1. Should I look for a new job after only being in the job for about 3 months? As the pay is low? & if not what would be the best way to generate more money?

2. Should I scale back investments and take all my money out and just save to afford all real estate expenses? 

3. Should I sell my computer and phone and see if I can downgrade to a cheaper option? 

4. Also, facing some pressure to move out and find my own place and also may need a car going into real estate, how can I afford this?

My little win (credit card),"Hi PFC. Long time lurker here, I came to Canada in 2017, so 2021 just marked my 4 years in the country. I remembered applying for my first RBC credit card and was given a $1000 CL Visa and that’s pretty much it lol. Thanks to the info from this sub, I’ve been trying my best to make all payments on time, keep the balance less than 30% CL, and always on the look out for credit limit increase..

It was pretty hard during the first two years but starting from end of 2018, my CL started to increase when I switched to another card at the same bank. It was $2500, then $5500 in 2019, and $11000 end of 2019 and today my CL hits $24000. 

Despite of having my SIN # starts with 9, I was able to raise my CL and eventually switch to a higher tier card with way better benefits / earn rate (something I never thought I’d be able to do as a low income earner / foreign student). 

To folks who share the background as me, keep working on your payment schedule, and you’ll eventually get there. Thanks PFC community for keeping me informed over the last 4 years about credit education, spending and everything in between. :)

I flew to Vancouver, so I am in quarantine for 10 days in case of any contact with covid on my flight, this is especially concerning as black mold is linked to respiratory illnesses and a weakened immune system.

My roommate (living here for 1.5 years) was not informed of humidity, water damages or mold issues of the unit prior to moving in. 
The landlord did not accompany me on a tour of the unit prior to etransfer of rent and the damage deposit.
I have brought up the issues to the landlord via email, and asked if he would be available before Jan 4, but I have gotten no response to come sooner.
I have read through the entire BC tenancy act regarding anything to do with these issues, but I am concerned I will not get my deposit back if I terminate tenancy early, or have to pay for my own living accommodations due to the health and safety of the unit.

34 M Looking for advice...,"Have not been the most financially responsible but have always made 70k+ up until my career position laid me off with a severance of 30 grand.

Foreign income and tax credit,"My wife immigrated to Canada from India. She had income in India before and after landing in Canada.

(Tangerine Bank) What are tax-free investment accounts?,"Sorry for the confusing question—I’ve googled for hours and still am not quite sure what this is.

Is this a TFSA account where the money can be put into investments? If so, then can I transfer all the money in my TFSA savings account to the tax-free investment account at once without penalty? Will the contribution room be calculated by taking the balance of both accounts? 

Similarly, Tangerine has an RSP account. Is this the same as an RRSP account? The description says it grows tax-free, so it sounds like it to me. 

Thank you so much for any replies! Very sorry for the beginner questions....

RRSP - Contribution Help,"Hello and Happy New Year! 

This sub has been incredibly helpful over the last year or so as I have really dialled into the importance of investing. I have been searching online for an answer to the below but I am unsure if I am correct in my understanding, as I arrived in Canada (Ontario) in 2018. 

In 2019, I over-contributed and I was subjected to a $46 fine which was waived by the CRA. What I am confused is about is when I log into my CRA account, it states the following: 

* 2020 RRSP deduction limit **$27,046.00**
* Unused RRSP contributions available to deduct for 2020 is **$8,067.00**

I know there have been some recent posts about this so apologies for the spam, somewhat confusing as I only arrived in Canada in 2018. 

|Year|RRSP Contribution Room|RRSP Contributions|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2018|$0|$0|
|2019|$9,000|$15,567|
|2020|$27,046|$17,327|
|**Total**|**$36,046**|**$32,894**|

My questions are - 

1. Have I over-contributed for 2020? I thought that I may have $3k left in my contribution room from the total rows but I am completely unsure now. 
2. The second bullet point, does that mean that I could only contribute $8,067.00 to my RRSP for 2020? 

**Note,** for 2021 I will have the max contribution room available ($27,830) and I was planning on deposit the max amount this month but will hold until I figure this out and speak to a CPA. In addition, I do not receive an employer match or DB. 

Thanks, everyone and excuse the spam, I'll speak to a CPA next week.",5,1609564341.0,2021,2021-01-02,,False_Clue_1642,6,korf1d

Permanent Life Insurance,"First off, happy new year folks. I'm hoping that things can't be worse than 2020 and with time and more vaccines arriving, 2021 will be more hopeful and prosperous year for everyone!

On to the question:
I'm looking for opinions and things too watch out for in considering permanent life insurance.

My accountant just dropped a short list of things to consider for this year's tax planning and this was among them.

I've always thought whole/permanent/universal life insurance to be a bit of a scam but upon initial research there's a tax benefits and transfer of wealth elements that's worth considering. 

Will def be consulting with trusted advisors but I'm looking for some community thoughts and experiences first... Any policies and underwriters to look out for, etc.

I created a Python script to optimize the allocation of new Canadian Couch Potato fund purchases. Does this interest anyone?,"Hi all,

As the title says, I've created a script to optimize the purchase of new funds in my Canadian Couch Potato portfolio. 

Long story short, I make regular cash deposits into my investment accounts and regularly buy new funds among those suggested by the CCP (specifically the TD e-series index funds). No idea if this is a good idea, but I try to allocate my available cash to purchase funds in a way that brings me closer to my target allocation. However, I was tired of trying to get closer to my target allocation by plugging the numbers into Excel and using a trial-and-error method (plus taking into account the 100$ minimum purchase!).

BTW, I have no idea if this is a smart idea compared to the periodic rebalancing of my funds (as suggested by CCP with the help of the rebalancing spreadsheet), but hey, I'm still learning.

Anyway, it's a Python script that uses a few packages to solve the optimization problem (MINLP for those that are curious) to offer an optimal amount to buy in each fund (including not buying a given fund). It does not suggest any fund sales however to further rebalance the portfolio.

Would this interest anyone? Would there be any value in sharing my script?",9,1609561770.0,2021,2021-01-01,,financequestionguy74,1,koqrfz

Choosing between Savings Plus Account vs. TFSA vs. GIC with EQ Bank? ADVICE?,"I have freshly graduated university, and I trying to decide on opening a savings account with EQ Bank. I start full time work in January, probably have $6000 in a mutual fund, $2000 in my chequing account, and $2000 in a work-related bank account (doesn't really do much).

In comparison, it seems like EQ bank has the best benefits for a simple savings account, but i'm trying to decide which one, for someone in my position, would be the best. I'm not sure what my long term goal would be for it, but i'd like to benefit from the interest rate and put in at least $2000 in it to start off and gradually put a little more in it (almost as if it was my emergency fund). 

Anyways, I was reading about their 1) EQ Savings Plus Account, 2) GIC account and 3) TSFA account.

I'd like some clarification on these individual items, which one would benefit me the most, and tbh, what the difference is for a GIC and a TFSA. Thank you!",21,1609560763.0,2021,2021-01-01,Banking,CareerCandy99,0,koqi7n

Friend of 15 years wants me to pay her $60.00 over a nonsensical restaurant bill she accumulated on to herself because...,"My friend and her husband wanted this lavish dinner at a specific restaurant for 20-25 guests during covid 19. I warned her based on logic and reasoning that MOST PEOPLE will not show up because of lockdown warnings. I was not insensitive about it, however I confirmed my reservation knowing I would prove her right, it was a very cold day that day. Somehow some establishments within the dynamics of the law were able to bypass the lockdown 4 weeks ago. She was so adamant on it because it was also for her one year wedding anniversary... I do not believe she has a realistic sense on the condition of 2020. It could not be me for this year. I turned 31 and had a very intimate birthday last month, and it did not require 25 people nor did I invite her based on the logic of a covid situation she works in a high exposure environment. Note that folks lol

She still made the reservations, and it is to my understanding this was not an a la carte (course meal arrangement)....  Rather! People would independently order what they wanted and the bills would be distributed. Now she is contacting everyone who did not arrive to the event demanding $60-70 back to cover her total costs this includes people she is not even close with but were extension invites, and I think that is in poor taste imo. Only 7 people arrived. Note that she chose a restaurant that was very out of distance from many people including myself. Nor did she regard those people with no cars.  Now $60 a la carte tells me this is not a fancy pants place because thats not remotely 5 star lol. However under the following principles:

1. So lets do the math folks she made this careless decision when i suggested not to (25-7)x60= $1080 < She can make this without effort and pay it.
2. 2.I cancelled on her TWO days before, because of a priority issue I had to deal with that she knows was a stressful yet brief scenario on that day that involved a family emergency that was unforeseen. However I still bought her a birthday gift and confirmed it with her.
3. I purchased her a beautiful wool knit sweater to her taste. She is going love it. I spent $50 on sale from the Hudson's Bay. She does not know how much it cost. I also bought her her dinning set last December when she got married.
4. I transferred some money into my high interest TFSA for the New year.
5. I have to finish paying off a $2300 tuition fee that will be due by the end of February, because I am an Engineering student. She knows this. I work at a very notable company that pays well. However I am not making the income she makes because I do not work full time. I need time also to study. She is not in college and works overtime hours, therefore her income is triple what I make. Her husband also makes good money and pays most of their bills. I am a bachelorette and pay my own bills. I purchased my pearl necklace I wanted as a gift for me, i made sure to treat myself for turning 31 and looking like Im 21 lol.
6. I dont expect a gift from her. She does not give gifts to non family members. She does cards.

What are your thoughts?  


EDIT: I will pay her the 60, and when I do. I will do it in person, and pay it in tens only so I will count it out slowly into her hand and make sure her husband is present so I can hand him her gift too. Its petty but I hope they feel ashamed and receive the message... Just to prove a point. It could never be me lol. ",40,1609559596.0,2021,2021-01-01,Misc,Ashanti_Angel,0,koq7er

Looking to switch banks,"Hi all, Effective March 1st, 2021, Scotia Bank will be increasing their monthly account fees, again.

I currently have the Preferred Package with Scotia. Since opening my account in 2016 with Scotia, here are a list of dates when their account fees increased.

Oct. 2016 - $12.95
April 2017 - $13.95
Nov. 2019 - $15.95
March 2021 - $16.95

I thought the fee of $15.95 was a lot, and we were never given breaks on our monthly fees due to the current pandemic, which we are still not clear of, and then they hit with another $1 increase?

I know $1 isn't a lot, even if you add it over 12 months. But, it's $203.40 a year to do banking with Scotia Bank? That is outrageous.

Is leasing really that bad of an idea?,"So I've always been told that leasing is a horrible idea financially and to always buy a used car. It is something I have always followed but I am getting tired of fixing other people's f*ck ups everytime I buy a used car, regardless of kilometers or age.

I do all my own work and by that I mean ALL vehicle work, including clutches, head gaskets, engine removals/installations and body work. The only work I get done from a shop are wheel alignments because there is no way I'm having an alignment rack installed in my garage. I've come to a point where I'm getting rather tired of finding issues caused by previous owner's cheapness or shoddy technician work. Dealers included.

Vehicle history:

1992 240SX - Paid $3750 for it in 2007 and was taken off the road due to corrosion issues in 2012. Previous owner never oiled the frame so it rusted. Clean title. Brake master cylinder failed while driving, and repaired. Car is now a lawn ornament.

1992 Toyota Camry - Paid $1500 in 2012. Found out it was in an unreported accident as the headlights would not aim correctly due to tweaked front end. Later discovered it had the wrong thermostat and cardboard was stuffed between radiator and condensor. Performed headgasket repairs by myself with OEM grade parts and still runs to this day. Another family member drives it. Clean title. Brake master cylinder also failed, and repaired.

2001 Subaru Impreza - Paid $2800 USD while studying in the states in early 2014. Still driving it and has close to 500,000 kms but will not pass inspection due to corrosion issues. Parts are not avaliable anymore to repair it. Spent quite a bit of money on it (new clutch, front CVs, radiator, brand new suspension components down to the nut with OEM grade parts) over the past 7 years (about $1500). Unfortunately, previous owner had a large portion of it bondod and paint professionally with urethane paint and clearcoat and a large number of susoension and axle components were installed backwards. Clean title.This too had a bad brake master cylinder...which was repaired.

There are just my personal cars, my family members have also dealt with similar issues with newer used cars such as a 2015 Camry, late 2000s Lexuses and various 90s Chrysler products (expected). It's always due to some low grade service job (including dealers). These cars were inspected by the so called professional vehicle inspectors (CAA, indie techs, dealers).

Now, while looking for a new car, I noticed that a brand new Chevrolet Spark can be had for $250 per month taxes in for 24 months. That's only 3 grand a year for a car that is brand new and hasn't been touched by technicians. And once that's done, return it and repeat. 

Yeah you never get to own it, but it's still a lot better than paying 3 grand for a used car that has a mysterious past and perhaps shoddy work done.

Anyone here have any good reasons why not to lease in this case?",38,1609552904.0,2021,2021-01-01,Auto,NotSoJDMGC4,5,kooe2z

Newcomer to investments. Need suggestions to invest a good chunk.,"Good evening everyone and happy new year.

I am just getting started with looking into methods of investing money. Seems to me, the safest route to take would be the 10 to 15 year long game, which I can do. Since TFSAs tend to give a lackluster return, I have been looking at index ETFs, combined stocks and bonds, REIT, robo advisers, etc...

Now, I'd like to get started sooner than later in investing $80,000. But I want to do it in way where I don't have much of a risk, where I have to kiss any of it goodbye, while being able to make something like 10% in returns annually. Is this feasible? Is this done with stock and bond trading? Or only equity stock trading? Or only asset allocation ETF trading? Would anyone in their right mind even suggest stock trading at all in this day and age, even in a low percentile along with bonds, with the shit market crash pandemic hell year we've had?

My parents are bad with money. The extent of it, I dont really know. They have 4 kids and the first 2 are already self sufficient adults while the 3rd one is in uni and the last one <10.
They live in Kelowna, BC. In the past 5 years, they've moved provinces twice. I know they're bad with money because I was raised not to save.
We're also an immigrant family so struggled a lot with money/jobs stability and overall adjusting on their parts. 


What stresses me out is my dad is currently unemployed (covid), my mom is working a job that probably pays around 15-20/hr (she didn't tell me). They have 2 cars, a mortgage, a LOT of debt (possibly in the form of LOCs and CC debt), and no retirement plans. They are about 20 years away from retirement (if that's even possible with their finances)


As they (and I) get older, I want to help them have some direction. My mom thinks as long as they keep paying the minimum of what they owe, eventually it'll allow them to pay down more when there's extra cash. They also put everything on credit (vacations, things they can't afford)


My mom refuses to talk to anyone who would recommend consolidating/whatever the step before bankruptcy is called because they think they can buy a house in the next 2-4 years. 


I want to find a financial advisor/planner who can HELP them understand where their financial future is sitting today and what they CAN and SHOULD do. My mom agreed to see whoever I recommend. Im also happy to pay for the service to get them started in this journey.

I always see people saying do not invest money you are not okay with losing. What does that even mean? The TFSA is my current savings (minus just a normal savings account with emergency funds), is it not invested right now, in a mutual fund? I am not willing to lose this money, but it’s in my TFSA. Is it okay to put the $45K in index funds, isn’t that the same thing as putting it into a mutual fund?",37,1609546034.0,2021,2021-01-01,,SynonymForAnonymous,11,komf71
What happens if interest rates blow up after the mortgage term and you can't pay them anymore?,"Just wondering what happens. Average terms here are 4-5 years, interest rates are around like 2% or even lower right now. Housing prices are high.

So what happens if I buy today, it's totally affordable and kosher, but when I go to renew 5 years from now, interest rates blow up to like 7-10% and I can't afford it anymore, despite getting a 300k or lower house, with 20% down or whatever. What actually happens when you loose a house, does the bank take out of your savings? Or is it just the downpayment + equity you put into the house goes to the lender, and you can keep your cash savings apart from it while taking a credit hit. I have no idea.

EDIT: I used 7-10% interest as a hyperbole, just any sort of increase in rates that pushes you out of affordability.",54,1609545620.0,2021,2021-01-01,,Dantai,12,komasw

Scotiabank Froze My Accounts?,"Hi all,

Just a quick question and I hope this is the right place.

I woke up this morning and tried to log into my Scotia account to transfer my rent money. I got an error saying that they had detected suspicious activity and to call the 1-800 number.

So I called and was transferred to the security team. I was THEN told that I had to go visit a branch in person on Monday and then have the branch call the security and fraud department.

They won’t tell me what the “suspicious acitivity” was. Keep in mind, it’s New Years Day and a Friday so to have to wait until Monday to deal with this is really stressing me out.

My some strange miracle, the ATM still let me withdraw cash, so I was able to pay my rent and can float by until Monday, but am very worried and confused.

Anytime I had suspicious activity with RBC, they always called me first and resolved the issue over the phone. I’ve NEVER had to go into the branch. 

The only things I did was get a refund from Canadian Tire, deposit 2 small cheque’s from my parents from Christmas, and transfer my rent money from one account to the other.

Has anyone dealt with this? Did you have to go into the branch? Was it a minor issue and easily resolved?! I’m sort of freaking out 😅

Thanks guys!",9,1609545326.0,2021,2021-01-01,,Cravingchange2222,1,kom7od

Stuck in a weird spot regarding relocating and selling my place,"I'm currently getting ready to sell my townhouse in Saskatoon since living in this setup has impacted my WFH performance a lot. Condos haven't been doing great in the market, and I'd also like to get into a detached home before the remote working future nukes it out of my price range. I've recently received a pretty great job offer from a company in Calgary that will require relocation once the restrictions on inter province travel are relaxed. I'm not quite sure when that will be but it seems like I have 3 choices:

1. Sell my place whenever covid calms down, buy a detached home in/near Calgary
2. Sell my place, buy a detached home in Saskatoon, live in it until I can rent it out while I rent a place in Calgary
3. Don't sell, rent the townhouse and rent a place in Calgary.

If I sell I have 2 months to buy a new place, do inspections, transfer CMHC insurance, and port my mortgage according to my broker. That puts me on a fairly tight timeline unfortunately. I've been reading threads and haven't heard many good things about the Calgary housing market, especially since after sale/fees I only have a bit less than 30k for a down payment, putting most nice detached places out of my reach. 


Important information on my current circumstances:
Single, 65k annual income, 242k left on my mortgage with potential selling price of 294k on the townhouse, after realtor fees / debt repayment that leaves me with a bit under 30k for a new property.

This is my first time moving jobs and relocating so there are so many factors that I don't think I've even thought of. Any guidance from more experienced people would be greatly appreciated!",11,1609542807.0,2021,2021-01-01,Housing,Dumais,0,kolfwj

"Against popular opinion, I will not contribute to my RRSP until I reach my 'expected' highest tax bracket. Convince me I'm wrong.","Throw away account. 

25 years old. 

Interested in stock investing.

From what I have seen, popular opinion is to max out registered accounts, then invest in regular taxable accounts.

This doesn't appear like a sound strategy to my naive brain. 

I expect my tax bracket to rise in the future (eg 5 years from now). If I transfer 60k to my RRSP when I'm in the higher tax bracket, ill save more income tax, than if I transfer the same 60k to my RRSP today (I have a lower tax bracket). 

If this is true, why does the popular opinion suggest maxing out RRSP? I'd guess most ppl on Reddit are younger, ambitious and therefore likely to experience a pay raise in the near/mid term.

Wouldn't it make more sense to entirely hold off on contributing  into an RRSP until you've reached your 'expected' highest tax bracket?

In the meantime, just simply invest that money in a taxable account with stocks that have capital gains only (to minimise disbursements) and save on the taxes there as well. 

Am I missing something?",29,1609542255.0,2021,2021-01-01,,throwaway64791,1,kol9qs
"""RRSP deduction limit"" vs. ""Unused RRSP contributions available to deduct""","In the CRA portal, there are two RRSP numbers, ""RRSP deduction limit 2020"" and ""Unused RRSP contributions available to deduct for 2020"". My understanding is that the deduction limit is the total amount that I can deduct for my 2020 personal income tax (ie. lower my taxable income), assuming that ""Unused RRSP contributions available to deduct for 2020"" is $0.

Question: the ""RRSP deduction limit 2020"" line refers to the deduction limit for 2020 but it is not really the total **contribution** limit since the ""RRSP deduction limit 2020"" is based on 2019 (and prior) earnings. The ""true"" total contribution limit should be the ""RRSP deduction limit 2020"" - ""Unused RRSP contributions available to deduct for 2020"" + 18% x 2020 earnings (up to 27,830) - 2020 pension adjustment, is this correct?

Is there some advantage in contribute more than the ""RRSP deduction limit 2020""? Even though you are not able to deduct it for 2020 tax year, the investment earnings in the RRSP allow the individual to defer tax (vs. a non-registered account)? Hence, there is some tax deferral benefit for contributing more than the deduction limit amount.",30,1609542069.0,2021,2021-01-01,,henry668,10,kol7k4
Brim cc—your experiences?,"I find myself occasionally shopping online from venues that would charge USD for the Canadian markets. Never thought twice about using my ""regular"" credit cards up until recently saw someone mention something about Brim and Rogers Visa having no fx fees with cashback so it piqued my interest.


I especially come to like what Brim says about the installment directly with them for any big purchases so it naturally got me to research a little further and here I am gathering some personal anecdotes and experiences before I decide which one to get—if at all.


What were your experiences like? Does the no fx fee justify having these cards? Are there any catches that may not be openly advertised? What was your experience with their installment options with all their fees and what have you?

Best way to buy US Stocks?,"Hi all,

I've got $6k of contribution room in my TFSA and my partner $10k. I have $12k in leftover cash ready to be invested and I expect to save about $25k more this year.
So far we've only invested in Canadian and US stocks in WealthSimple Trade.
I'd like to spend about 75% of my cash into US stocks and 25% into Canadian ones, without spending too much in fees. I'd like to also gamble about $1k in option trading outside of my TFSA (just for fun & learning about it)

Am I correct to assume that the best and cheapest way to invest my money is to:

- Buy Canadian stocks on WealthSimple Trade (100% free)
- Add all the rest of my money into Questrade in a CAD account, buy DLR, ask Questrade to transform it into DLR.U (Norbert Gambit) and sell it (which will transform my CAD into USD for free)
-  Buy US stocks with the USD
- Gamble some options with the USD (outside TFSA)

My questions are:

- Is this a good plan? Should I worry about doing the Norbert's gambit when I'm just converting about ~$25k or should I simply buy my US stocks on WS Trade?
- How legal is Norbert's Gambit? Do Questrade sometimes refuse to journal the shares? Is it considered as a loophole or a completely normal thing to do?
- Can you have a USD TFSA account in Questrade?

Down payment is most of my savings. What to do?,"To start things off:

Me: 35 living in BC (Vancouver island so real estate is still ridiculous) making 93k a year with potential for 20% bonus at year end. No debts. Sending around 2k a month into rrsp / tfsa savings combo. 

My partner: 30 making ~70k a year but a lot of school debt (roughly 90k) no substantial savings (school really fucked them)

I have a maxed out TFSA in wealthsimple invest and ~100k in RRSP wealth simple invest and another ~40k in cash savings

A potential windfall of another 100k may be heading my way in January. 

I currently am extremely fortunate to be paying $1000 in rent split with my common-law partner. However it is a 1 bedroom and we are feeling cramped for space. Finding a larger place to rent would mean a massive increase in rent costs. 

I’m at a loss of what to do next. 

Due to my partners financial circumstance buying a place (needs to be at least a 2bedroom) = me paying for the entire down payment which would be almost all my savings (with 35k out of my rrsp)

Should we suck it up and live in our cheap housing for as long as possible? Or would converting most of my savings into a home make more sense?",12,1609540244.0,2021,2021-01-01,,Tight_Network6127,2,koknyd

Building house remotely an option?,"After reading a few websites and posts on PFC, I’m 90% sure that building a custom home on Vancouver Island (while living in Toronto) isn’t an option.

But as there are people out there with way more experience than I have on this matter, I wanted to test a few hypothesis to ensure I really need to let this dream go:
- buying vacant land needs to be 100% self-funded, as banks only allow a construction mortgage when building has actually started (right?) (don’t want to spend all my cash on this)
- building a small 900sq.ft. home (from scratch till handing over the keys; all-in) will cost at least 300K plus (somewhere on the east coast of Vanc Island between Duncan and Cambell River) (making an educated guess here)
- not being there while people are building (like a 5 hour flight which I’d rather not take until I’m vaccinated) brings up heaps of challenges (wildly guessing here)

W-8BEN for Company Stock - consequences of not keeping up to date?,"Five years ago I worked for a US based company and I was allowed to buy their stock at 5% discount.  I bought a small amount (about $2500 US) before I left the company.

It pays out about $16 of dividends each year, and around $2 is withheld.  They keep sending me W-8BEN forms which I have not bothered to fill in since I really don't care about the $2 withheld.  The stock itself however has grown over x3 during these years.

What are the implications of not having the W-8BEN on file, other than the withheld taxes on dividends?  I'm assuming that if I ever cash out the stock there will be withholding taxes on the gains at that point, so I'm wondering if I can just wait until then to file a W-8BEN?

Main reason I haven't bothered is because I'm not sure how to fill in a couple lines, specifically what my Foreign Tax Identifying Number is (my SIN?) and Part II to identify Tax Treaty Benefits, although some searches on this sub seem to indicate I should cite Article X and claim 15% rate(?).",5,1609533352.0,2021,2021-01-01,Taxes,JoeBlack23,1,koij3b
Effect of accepting pre-approved line of credit on mortgage application 8 months from now,"My partner and I are hoping to buy our first house in the fall or end of 2021. 

I still have student debt on both OSAP and a Professional Student Line of Credit with Scotiabank. The Professional Student Line of Credit was converted into a loan in the spring of 2020 as I've been out of school for a couple of years. 

Scotiabank recently offered me a $20,000 pre-approved personal line of credit at prime + 2.35% (total of 4.8% with the current prime rate). I'm  considering accepting it to have in case of emergencies. As I've read in other posts - its easier to come across a line of credit when things are going well, but it won't be easy to seek credit if I'm every in a situation where I actually need it. 

I am looking for your views on whether accepting the personal line of credit would affect my chances of getting approved for a mortgage around fall 2021. My credit score is  just over 800. I always pay off my credit card balance in full (and have started paying it off in full on a weekly basis). I will still have 2-3 years left of payments on my student loans by the time we apply for a mortgage. 

My main concerns are:

\- banks could assume that after getting the mortgage I could max out the personal line of credit. I realize that they could simply ask me to close it down, but is there a chance they could deny the mortgage all together? 

\- This \^ could be made worse by the fact that I still have student loans. 

\- The new personal line of credit would reduce the average age of my credit.

\- On the other hand, from what I understand, once I finish paying off my Professional Student Line of Credit (now a loan), this will not count towards my credit history, making the average age of my credit history shorter. The only credit accounts I have open are 1 credit card, the bank student loan and OSAP student loan. Not sure if this somehow affects the decision on whether to accept the new line of credit.

Newish to Canada. RRSP vs TFSA- ELI5,"Hi everyone,

Please comment on my $ Saving Strategy,"Hi,

I created a throwaway to shield my identity, I wanted to create this post to share how I am currently saving money to purchase a home and start a family. I am 29 and live in Toronto, one of the most unaffordable cities to live in the world.

**Goal:** I want to purchase a home in the 700K-850K range, somewhere outside of the GTA because I cannot afford anything else in GTA area. I wish to save up and start a family (1-2 children) and take vacations here and there while paying off mortgage. 

**I wish to put 20% down-payment, which is $160,000**

**My Income:** daily 9-6 job that pays a little over 90K / annually, defined benefit pension

Girlfriend (will wife her soon) makes about 70K / annually.

**Current living situation:** 

$6000 annual rent (living at home with parents)  
$1600 annual insurance  
$550 annual phone bill

\+ discretionary spending (a few vacations a year (10K), and spending money on the side  

**Current saving strategy:**

$50K in cash in my RRSP in a 2-year GIC earning 2%  
$20K in cash in my chequing bank account (earning 0% interest)  
$20K in TFSA with stocks (I bought some holdings in over 10-12 companies on the stock market)

I do not really have a strategy except for spending a bit of my next few paycheques over to my TFSA and continue to purchase stocks. I am not even sure if that is a good idea because I think the stock market right now is higher than pre-corona levels and our economy and health of our citizens are suffering at the moment. I believe that people do not have a way to spend their money right now with COVID-19, and that is why people are buying more stocks, hence pumping up the prices of shares.  Once people need their cash again once the economy opens, I believe people will sell their stocks and will cause overall stock market decline.

Do you guys have any comments or advice for me to save up for a $160,000 downpayment and eventually start a family here for me?

Family and retirement planning on 100k income in Toronto,"My wife and I are in our late 20's and currently live in the GTA. We rent a 4bdr house with another couple. Our combined costs for rent and utilities are \~3500/mo for the 4 of us divided equally. Our landlord and roommates are fairly stable and we see ourselves living together here for at least the next few years (with our without kids)

We both work in the public sector and earn 50k and 55k gross respectively. We just paid off all our debts and live a fairly minimal lifestyle with one car. For the last 2 years we have been saving 2500$/mo and currently have 60k saved up in a HISA. Regarding the biggest cost of children (daycare) our parents are healthy and will be happy to take care of them until they start school. 

Sadly home ownership seems unattainable so to live in a house might mean we will be renting for a very very long time. I am not a fan of condo's at all but it seems to be all we can barely afford. I've never lived in a condo before but reading about condo fees really scares us. To compound on this fear our roommates invested in a rental condo in 2017 and have been losing money on it. They regularly talk about cutting their losses and selling. 

Are there any couples on this sub doing family and retirement planning with similar income in Toronto/GTA area? What do your plans and lives look like?

"60% XAW, XIC 30%, 10% ZAG, any opinions?","24yo new investor, planning is to invest long-term (30 years minimum) so I was thinking about ETFs (with my TFSA in Questrade). Starting with an amount of 5000$ and will be contributing either quarterly or annually (up to 2400$ annually until I graduate). 

Does this sound like a good ETF portfolio or would an XGRO/VGRO-type all-in-one make more sense. I figured my current allocation could potentially lead to higher gains, but then again I could be wrong.

I understand the risks coming with only 10% allocated to bonds currently, but will increase the bond % allocation later on.

How to handle TD insurance? They making me pay for the insurance on a loaner car,"I think I understand now why they quoted me the lowest rates.

I got in a no-fault accident a few weeks ago, cars undrivable and getting written off.
Disclaimer: I didn't have loaner/rental car coverage on my policy, but since I'm not at fault, the other party's insurance(also TD) is covering it.

It took them 3 days to finally get me a loaner, but the gal said they would NOT pay for the insurance on the car. In my desperation for a loaner I said okay whatever(did i ""legally"" now agree to pay for this BS insurance on it?).

The workers at the rental place saw a note on the file that TD would not be covering the insurance on the car, they seemed to find that strange.

I haven't been able to call anyone at TD insurance that can help me, it seems like they've all been on vacation since Dec 23rd, and only get in contact when THEY want something from me(eg the injury benefits claim I'm pursuing).

I emailed one of the insurance agents asking if I could pay for the rental myself and submit a claim for it after(my TD visa would cover part of the insurance on it) but she didn't get back to me until day 7/10 that I had the loaner.

The rentals been returned now, had to pay $230 for the insurance on it($18/day) I'm entitled to more time with it, but don't feel like paying $18/day.

So now my sentiment is: great, through no fault of my own I no longer have a car, and am being made to pay for part of the loaner I was provided with. All this just before Xmas, with an 8 month pregnant wife at home, now I have to rush to buy a new car, thanks TD!

TLDR: after a no fault accident, TD insurance made me pay for the car insurance on the loaner they provided. 

Has anyone had a similar experience with their insurer? is this standard practice? What courses of action can I take with these blood suckers?",7,1609529430.0,2021,2021-01-01,Insurance,ABcarcrash2020,2,kohbml

Apartment vs condo: which would be better at this time?,"So right now, I'm planning on moving out of my current apartment into one that is more spacious. Right now my current apartment is small, cramped, and significantly ant-infested, and I feel it is time for a change. Given how low rental rates are right now, I've already made some requests for viewings. However, my dad recently also put forward the proposition that I could go for a condo, and he could give me a down payment on a mortgage that I could pay off over the next several years.

Some thoughts on this:

\-1. I'm making a solid salary of slightly more than 3400 a month (currently going on a rent of slightly over 940), but my girlfriend's current job underpays her, and she has expressed concerns regarding this in terms of contribution. Neither of us plan to have kids.

\-2. My sister has avidly suggested moving to a place with cheap condo units like Hamilton and taking the GO bus to work, or working from home. After going through a year of literally not seeing any of my friends, this might be a bit hard.

\-3. My current job pays well, and gives benefits, but I'm not certain how long I want to stay in this position. If I need to move, or want to simply shift to a new job, then I'm concerned that having a mortgage will make that difficult.

\-4. I honestly don't know what is more pricey in the long run: paying rent, or having a mortgage and thus having to pay for maintenance/utilities/upkeep on my own instead.

As of right now RRSPs are of the top of my mind, but if we forego that, what else can we do? Perhaps ask our respective employers to ""take off more taxes"" in each paycheque?

[Update] sharing some improvements to my budget tracking spreadsheet -- track your money in 2021 and beyond!,"Happy new year everyone!

A couple years back, I built a spreadsheet for tracking and visualizing your expenses & income, and [shared it with this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/8c7gn1/i_built_a_spreadsheet_to_track_my_budget_and/). The feedback was amazing, and even today PFC users continue to stumble upon it.

I spent a few days this holiday break to make some improvements to the sheet, and wanted to share it again.

You can find the **[new and improved budget tracking tool here](https://themeasureofaplan.com/budget-tracking-tool/?v=clean)**. It's available as an excel or google sheets spreadsheet -- both have the same features, so it's just up to your preference.

The changes include...

&nbsp;

-----

A new layout for the Dashboard tab -- see example here: [https://imgur.com/a/dx9EFul](https://imgur.com/a/dx9EFul)

This tab shows you at a glance:

* Your total income, expenses, and savings over any time period
* A month-by-month trending view of your finances
* Breakdowns into individual categories — i.e., how much of your total spending came from rent, eating out, groceries, car payment, etc.
* Comparisons of your spending and income against your personal budget targets

The time period is adjustable, so you can see the last 3, 6, or 12 months, all months, or any custom time period.

&nbsp;

-----


A new ""Historical Comparison"" tab has been added, which allows you to compare your finances in one time period against another period.

For example, this can be used to compare your income / expenses / savings in 2020 versus 2019 -- [https://imgur.com/a/SfRdj62](https://imgur.com/a/SfRdj62)

When I look at my own expenses in 2020 versus 2019, I can clearly see the impact of COVID on my spending.

Overall, my expenses decreased by about 10% in 2020. The tab also shows the comparison on a category-by-category basis. For me, the bulk of the drop in spending came from:

* Travel -- down by 60%
* Clothing -- down by 90% (thanks to WFH and wearing holey socks more than I care to admit...)
* Restaurants -- down by 55%

On the other hand, my spending increased in a few categories; again, pretty standard pandemic stuff:

* Groceries -- up by 55%
* Telecom -- up by 15% (thanks to my friendly neighbourhood ISP...)
* Utilities -- up by 10%

You can toggle the comparison for a month-over-month view, year-over-year view, or any other custom time periods.

&nbsp;


-----


Whether you want to plug in your expenses throughout 2020 to summarize where your dollars went in the year, or if you just want to start your tracking fresh in 2021, I encourage you to start tracking your finances!

I've got more than 5 years of data in my own spreadsheet, and it's been really useful for seeing how my spending has changed over time (groceries +, travel +, going out -), and also for making long-term retirement plans (i.e., how much do I need to spend to maintain my quality of life, do I want to spend more in certain categories).

If there's any questions or feedback about the sheet please let me know.

Cheers to a better year ahead, good health, and growing wealth!

Question about Unused RRSP contributions available - CRA Account,"Hello PFCI will try to make it short and to the point, if any context is missing I'll edit the OP

* end **April of 2019** I completed the purchase of a house
* I wanted to withdraw the maximum possible with the HBP
* I (tried to be creative and) contributed on **Jan 9 2019** to my RRSP (because of the 90 day rule ) based on my ""expected"" contribution room from 2018 income (I had already maxed out everything up until then) for the sake of simplicity let's say it was $5,000
* I confirmed with the CRA that as long as I'm confident my calculations are right (no over contributions) they see no issue with contributing before a notice of assessment is issued
* The intention was to withdraw after 90 days and claim the deduction in 2019 (not sure if that was even possible, in fact, my accountant ""did not"" claim any RRSP deductions in 2019)
* Now come 2020 tax season, I expected to have that contribution available for deduction, however:
* CRA account shows: *Unused RRSP contributions available to deduct for 2020 is $0.00*

So what exactly went wrong here? are the CRA *contributions available* numbers calculated based on my prior year tax returns or based on what the FI's share with them (I received the slips on **Jan 18 2019**)

In summary:

* Deduction limit is all clear and as expected

- $15k invested in Questrade TFSA (90% equity)
- $90k invested in fixed deposits back in home country 
- $90k invested in Canadian savings bank accounts
- $31k in online poker account 
- $10k cash 

My net worth has been stagnant since a long time as it’s mainly savings from online poker winnings prior to 2013 (while I was playing in my home country) and I’m wondering how to boost it. Almost all of my monthly winnings are being used up in rent and expenses.

Should I throw some $$$ into BTC or something?",52,1609512376.0,2021,2021-01-01,,jdsazjdaka,0,kocd9o
Canada Training Credits - Accumulation,"I am reading that the Canada Training Credit accumulates:

[Let me take the example of William, a 30-year-old software developer who wants to learn a new coding language. He takes up a course, which has a $4,000 tuition fee, in 2023. By then, he will have $1,000 accumulated in his education fund, and he can claim this entire amount under the Canada Training Credit. ](https://www.fool.ca/2020/12/30/canada-revenue-agency-get-your-250-canada-training-credit-before-december-31/) 

I only have a few courses to complete my degree, at a cost of ~$4700. I am not in a hurry; I have a good job that doesn't require a degree but it may benefit me towards the latter part of my career.

Would it make sense to wait until I have accumulated the full amount of this credit?",14,1609510475.0,2021,2021-01-01,,500mLwater,62,kobx4u
TransUnion & Equifax dispute?,"Hey all, does anyone know exactly what a creditor must provide the credit reporting agencies to validate an account?

I’ve called virgin and they say they can’t find the account and they have no documentation, but transunion said virgin told them it’s legitimate.

Using my Small Business Account for investing in Stocks,"
Hey everyone!
I have a question about Small Business Account and investing, 

So - I have a small business account with TD, I have some money in there and I would like to invest it in stocks as a Med to Longterm hold. 
I have opened the TD direct investing account

I would like to know if I get Tax at 50% of the capital gains or the whole Capital gains will be taxed?

I'm wondering if there are any limitations in using my business account? So far I have only received payments for the contracting work I've done on the side 

Oh, also I am a Permanent Resident, so there shouldn't be any limitations of that kind.

Thank you so much in advance! I'd greatly appreciate any advice/explanation given!",7,1609494828.0,2021,2021-01-01,,humami1on2006,5,ko8ttp

Is there a quick way to convert all $USD transaction to $CDN in brokerage account when doing taxes or is all this done manually??,"Hi,

This year I will have dozens, maybe hundreds of $USD transactions that will need to be converted to $CDN using the exchange rate from sale and purchase dates in my brokerage account. In the past since I had so few transactions I did all this manually.

Is there some sort of software or excel sheet that has all the daily exchange rates where I would only need to enter the sale/purchase amounts and all this would be converted easily and quickly?  


What's the fastest way to get all this done for tax purposes without hiring someone else to do the work?",8,1609486069.0,2021,2021-01-01,Taxes,hydewolf,3,ko7bji
"Signed a one year lease agreement at new apartment, and pay each month for a parking stall - It has been two weeks and zero stall has been assigned to me","Moved into a new apartment complex on Dec.14th. I pay an additional $75 per month for a parking spot assigned to me. It is now over two weeks since I received the keys to my apartment, and I still have not been given a spot to park. I have already paid a prorated rent amount for half of the month, and paid the full $75 for a parking spot. I was given a visitor parking sticker, but am unable to park in the visitor spots as there are only two for a 6 level apartment buildings with close to 100 other tenants. These visitor spaces are always full, and I have never been able to park in them.   


I have emailed, called, and sent multiple text messages to my property manager/building management company, and have not been given one response in regards to my assigned parking stall that I have already paid for. It is now the first of the month ( in less than 40 minutes ) and my next rental payment, plus the $75 for my parking stall, has been withdrawn from my bank account. I sent an additional email again today making it the fourth email, and one more text message to my property manager ( 9th message ) and called their office with again, zero answer.  I have had to park close to a 20 minute walk away from my building, as the closest location allowing me to park is a small strip mall in which I contacted the owners, explained my situation, and they graciously allowed me to park overnight with a parking pass.   


What do I do in this situation? This management company was very responsive until the day I took possession of the apartment, and then it seems as they have ceased all communications with me. I would like a refund for the $75 for the month of December, considering I spent close to 8 hours in two weeks, walking back and forth to my car. Is this legal?  


Thank you.",28,1609485920.0,2021,2021-01-01,,Longbtc2021,67,ko7ajp
Can I still use my Tution Tax Credit in Alberta in the 2020 year?,"I graduated back in 2019 and have about 20k in unused Tution tax credits. I read online that Alberta was eliminating the Tution Tax credit starting 2020 as part of their budget changes. The webpage at [https://turbotax.intuit.ca/tips/tuition-tax-credits-in-alberta-11074](https://turbotax.intuit.ca/tips/tuition-tax-credits-in-alberta-11074) states that "" With the 2020 budget for Alberta, many students will see a decrease in the ability to claim tuition tax credits in Alberta for this coming year. That said, all years previous to 2020 will be eligible for tuition tax credits in Alberta, if the student meets the qualifications. "". Obviously given that the years prior to 2020 have came and went I am assuming this means if the credit was for tution paid prior to the year 2020 it can still be used for deducting taxes in later years and that the budget changes only impact students who are still enrolled? Is this correct? Also is it possible to use all my tax credits within one year assuming I have paid more taxes this year than the credit will deduct?

HELOC - Good or Bad Idea?,"I am looking at buying my own home for the first time in my life (divorcing).  I would like to buy an older home in a very nice mature area and renovate.  I have always wanted to do this. The banks won’t qualify me for much on my own, though I should qualify for enough to buy the home.

Should I set myself up with a HELOC as soon as I get my mortgage (with the plan to use it for future renovations) or is there a better way to accomplish my goals?

I am educated, make a comfortable living, and consider myself good at money management, but now that I am on my own with 2 kids, I want to make sure I make the best decision.

The bank, of course, is trying to get me to sign up for the HELOC (which always seems to be the case).  I’m just not sure if this really the best thing to do.",5,1609482318.0,2021,2021-01-01,,throwaway5736709,0,ko6kar
Business fails to profit due to sales tax,"Hi All, Happy new year,

Starting now in 2021 i had to register my business to collect tax, without going into detail, I wont be charging customers tax but rather just consuming this cost myself. I am in a extremely price compatible industry, the same product I have for sale for $xxx you can find someone else selling the exact same item for the same price, thus if I increased my prices I probably would loose near to 90% of my total business due to customers being able to get cheaper prices, the other issue with this is my profit margins are not giant, meaning consuming this retail tax Is going to really effect my business. 

&#x200B;

I guess my question is, does anyone have any type of experience with this? On some of my sales the government will make more money than i will. And that doesn't seem fair / right. I want to play fully by the rules and don't want to cut any corners or anything, as that isn't how i am, however i also don't want to be working on my business but profit only going to the government.

What’s the correct asset allocation between stocks and real estate?,"Homes (like in the GTA) can easily make up a huge portion of your portfolio. 
1. What asset allocation should you maintain?
2. How do you “rebalance” over your lifetime since real estate can’t be fractioned? 
3. How should you draw down in retirement? Most people seem to spend all the stocks first and leave the home equity til the end — isn’t that risky?",26,1609480477.0,2021,2021-01-01,,fqanas2,0,ko6565
